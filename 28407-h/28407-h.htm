<h2>PRESS NOTICES OF FIRST EDITION.</h2>


<p>"It would be hard to name a better commonplace book for summer
lawns.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The lover of poetry, the lover of gardening, and the lover
of quaint, out-of-the-way knowledge will each find something to please
him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is a delightful example of gardening literature."&mdash;<i>Pall
Mall Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Ellacombe, with a double enthusiasm for Shakespeare and for
his garden, has produced a very readable and graceful volume on the
Plant-Lore of Shakespeare."&mdash;<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Ellacombe brings to his task an enthusiastic love of horticulture,
wedded to no inconsiderable practical and theoretical knowledge
of it; a mind cultivated by considerable acquaintance with the
Greek and Latin classics, and trained for this special subject by a course
of extensive reading among the contemporaries of his author: and a
capacity for patient and unwearied research, which he has shown by
the stores of learning he has drawn from a class of books rarely dipped
into by the student&mdash;Saxon and Early English herbals and books of
leechcraft; the result is a work which is entitled from its worth to a
place in every Shakesperian library."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p>"The work has fallen into the hands of one who knows not only the
plants themselves, but also their literary history; and it may be said
that Shakespeare's flowers now for the first time find an historian."&mdash;<i>Field.</i></p>

<p>"A delightful book has been compiled, and it is as accurate as it is
delightful."&mdash;<i>Gardener's Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Ellacombe's book well deserves a place on the shelves of both
the student of Shakespeare and the lover of plant lore."&mdash;<i>Journal of
Botany.</i></p>

<p>"By patient industry, systematically bestowed, Mr. Ellacombe has
produced a book of considerable interest; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. full of facts, grouped
on principles of common sense about quotations from our great poet."&mdash;<i>Guardian.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Ellacombe is an old and faithful labourer in this field of
criticism. His 'Plant-lore and Garden-craft of Shakespeare' .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
is the fullest and best book on the subject."&mdash;<i>The Literary World
(American).</i></p>

<h2>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h2>


<p>Since the publication of the First Edition I have received
many kind criticisms both from the public critics and from
private friends. For these criticisms I am very thankful,
and they have enabled me to correct some errors and to
make some additions, which I hope will make the book
more acceptable and useful.</p>

<p>For convenience of reference I have added the line
numbers to the passages quoted, taking both the quotations
and the line numbers from the Globe Shakespeare. In a
few instances I have not kept exactly to the text of the
Globe Edition, but these are noted; and I have added
the "Two Noble Kinsmen," which is not in that Edition.</p>

<p>In other respects this Second Edition is substantially the
same as the First.</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.</h2>


<p>The following Notes on the "Plant-lore and Garden-craft
of Shakespeare" were published in "The Garden" from
March to September, 1877.</p>

<p>They are now republished with additions and with such
corrections as the altered form of publication required or
allowed.</p>

<p>As the Papers appeared from week to week, I had to
thank many correspondents (mostly complete strangers to
myself) for useful suggestions and inquiries; and I would
again invite any further suggestions or remarks, especially
in the way of correction of any mistakes or omissions that
I may have made, and I should feel thankful to any one
that would kindly do me this favour.</p>

<p>In republishing the Papers, I have been very doubtful
whether I ought not to have rejected the cultural remarks
on several of the plants, which I had added with a special
reference to the horticultural character of "The Garden"
newspaper. But I decided to retain them, on finding that
they interested some readers, by whom the literary and
Shakespearean notices were less valued.</p>

<p>The weekly preparation of the Papers was a very pleasant
study to myself, and introduced me to much literary and
horticultural information of which I was previously ignorant.
In republishing them I hope that some of my readers may
meet with equal pleasure, and with some little information
that may be new to them.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p><span class="dropcapa"><span class="dropcap">A</span></span>LL the commentators on Shakespeare
are agreed upon one point, that he
was the most wonderfully many-sided
writer that the world has yet seen.
Every art and science are more or
less noticed by him, so far as they
were known in his day; every business
and profession are more or less
accurately described; and so it has
come to pass that, though the main
circumstances of his life are pretty well known, yet the
students of every art and science, and the members of every
business and profession, have delighted to claim him as
their fellow-labourer. Books have been written at various
times by various writers, which have proved (to the complete
satisfaction of the writers) that he was a soldier,<a name="FNanchor_1:1_1" id="FNanchor_1:1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1:1_1" class="fnanchor">[1:1]</a> a sailor, a
lawyer,<a name="FNanchor_1:2_2" id="FNanchor_1:2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1:2_2" class="fnanchor">[1:2]</a> an astronomer, a physician,<a name="FNanchor_1:3_3" id="FNanchor_1:3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1:3_3" class="fnanchor">[1:3]</a> a divine,<a name="FNanchor_1:4_4" id="FNanchor_1:4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_1:4_4" class="fnanchor">[1:4]</a> a printer,<a name="FNanchor_1:5_5" id="FNanchor_1:5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_1:5_5" class="fnanchor">[1:5]</a> an

what else besides.</p>

<p>I also propose to claim him as a fellow-labourer. A lover
of flowers and gardening myself, I claim Shakespeare as
equally a lover of flowers and gardening; and this I propose
to prove by showing how, in all his writings, he exhibits his
strong love for flowers, and a very fair, though not perhaps a
very deep, knowledge of plants; but I do not intend to go
further. That he was a lover of plants I shall have no
difficulty in showing; but I do not, therefore, believe that he
was a professed gardener, and I am quite sure he can in
no sense be claimed as a botanist, in the scientific sense of
the term. His knowledge of plants was simply the knowledge
that every man may have who goes through the world
with his eyes open to the many beauties of Nature that
surround him, and who does not content himself with simply
looking, and then passing on, but tries to find out something
of the inner meaning of the beauties he sees, and to carry
away with him some of the lessons which they were doubtless
meant to teach. But Shakespeare was able to go further
than this. He had the great gift of being able to describe
what he saw in a way that few others have arrived at; he
could communicate to others the pleasure that he felt himself,
not by long descriptions, but by a few simple words, a
few natural touches, and a few well-chosen epithets, which
bring the plants and flowers before us in the freshest, and
often in a most touching way.</p>

<p>For this reason the study of the Plant-lore of Shakespeare
is a very pleasant study, and there are other things which
add to this pleasure. One especial pleasure arises from the
thoroughly English character of his descriptions. It has often
been observed that wherever the scenes of his plays are laid,
and whatever foreign characters he introduces, yet they really
are all Englishmen of the time of Elizabeth, and the scenes
are all drawn from the England of his day. This is certainly
true of the plants and flowers we meet with in the plays; they
are thoroughly English plants that (with very few exceptions)
he saw in the hedgerows and woods of Warwickshire,<a name="FNanchor_2:2_7" id="FNanchor_2:2_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_2:2_7" class="fnanchor">[2:2]</a> or in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>[<a href="./images/3.png">3</a>]</span>his own or his friends' gardens. The descriptions are thus
thoroughly fresh and real; they tell of the country and of
the outdoor life he loved, and they never smell of the study
lamp. In this respect he differs largely from Milton, whose
descriptions (with very few exceptions) recall the classic and
Italian writers. He differs, too, from his contemporary
Spenser, who has certainly some very sweet descriptions of
flowers, which show that he knew and loved them, but are
chiefly allusions to classical flowers, which he names in such
a way as to show that he often did not fully know what they
were, but named them because it was the right thing for a
classical poet so to do. Shakespeare never names a flower
or plant unnecessarily; they all come before us, when they
do come, in the most natural way, as if the particular flower
named was the only one that could be named on that
occasion. We have nothing in his writings, for instance,
like the long list of trees described (and in the most interesting
way) in the first canto of the First Book of the "Faerie
Queene," and indeed he is curiously distinct from all his
contemporaries. Chaucer, before him, spoke much of
flowers and plants, and drew them as from the life. In the
century after him Herrick may be named as another who
sung of flowers as he saw them; but the real contemporaries
of Shakespeare are, with few exceptions,<a name="FNanchor_3:1_8" id="FNanchor_3:1_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_3:1_8" class="fnanchor">[3:1]</a> very silent on the
subject. One instance will suffice. Sir Thomas Wyatt's
poems are all professedly about the country&mdash;they abound
in woods and vales, shepherds and swains&mdash;yet in all his
poems there is scarcely a single allusion to a flower in a
really natural way. And because Shakespeare only introduces
flowers in their right place, and in the most purely
natural way, there is one necessary result. I shall show that
the number of flowers he introduces is large, but the number
he omits, and which he must have known, is also very large,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[<a href="./images/4.png">4</a>]</span>and well worth noting.<a name="FNanchor_4:1_9" id="FNanchor_4:1_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_4:1_9" class="fnanchor">[4:1]</a> He has no notice, under any name,
of such common flowers as the Snowdrop, the Forget-me-Not,
the Foxglove, the Lily of the Valley,<a name="FNanchor_4:2_10" id="FNanchor_4:2_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_4:2_10" class="fnanchor">[4:2]</a> and many others
which he must have known, but which he has not named;
because when he names a plant or flower, he does so not to
show his own knowledge, but because the particular flower
or plant is wanted in the particular place in which he uses it.</p>

<p>Another point of interest in the Plant-lore of Shakespeare
is the wide range of his observation. He gathers flowers for
us from all sorts of places&mdash;from the "turfy mountains" and
the "flat meads;" from the "bosky acres" and the "unshrubbed
down;" from "rose-banks" and "hedges even-pleached."
But he is equally at home in the gardens of the
country gentlemen with their "pleached bowers" and "leafy
orchards." Nor is he a stranger to gardens of a much higher
pretension, for he will pick us famous Strawberries from the
garden of my Lord of Ely in Holborn; he will pick us White
and Red Roses from the garden of the Temple; and he will
pick us "Apricocks" from the royal garden of Richard the
Second's sad queen. I propose to follow Shakespeare into
these many pleasant spots, and to pick each flower and note
each plant which he has thought worthy of notice. I do not
propose to make a selection of his plants, for that would not
give a proper idea of the extent of his knowledge, but to note
every tree, and plant, and flower that he has noted. And as
I pick each flower, I shall let Shakespeare first tell us all he
has to say about it; in other words, I shall quote every
passage in which he names the plant or flower; for here,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>[<a href="./images/5.png">5</a>]</span>again, it would not do to make a selection from the passages,
my object not being to give "floral extracts," but to let him
say all he can in his own choice words. There is not much
difficulty in this, but there is difficulty in determining how
much or how little to quote. On the one hand, it often
seems cruel to cut short a noble passage in the midst of which
some favourite flower is placed; but, on the other hand, to
quote at too great a length would extend the book beyond
reasonable limits. The rule, therefore, must be to confine
the quotations within as small a space as possible, only taking
care that the space is not so small as entirely to spoil the
beauty of the description. Then, having listened to all that
Shakespeare has to say on each flower, I shall follow with
illustrations (few and short) from contemporary writers; then
with any observations that may present themselves in the
identification of Shakespeare's plant with their modern representatives,
finishing each with anything in the history or
modern uses or cultivation of the plant that I think will
interest readers.</p>

<p>For the identification of the plants, we have an excellent
and trustworthy guide in John Gerard, who was almost an
exact contemporary of Shakespeare. Gerard's life ranged
from 1545 to 1612, and Shakespeare's from 1564 to 1616.
Whether they were acquainted or not we do not know, but
it is certainly not improbable that they were; I should think
it almost certain that they must have known each other's
published works.<a name="FNanchor_5:1_11" id="FNanchor_5:1_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_5:1_11" class="fnanchor">[5:1]</a></p>

<p>The plant here named as being as powerful in its action
as gunpowder is the Aconitum Napellus (the Wolf's bane
or Monk's-hood). It is a member of a large family, all of
which are more or less poisonous, and the common Monk's-hood
as much so as any. Two species are found in America,
but, for the most part, the family is confined to the northern
portion of the Eastern Hemisphere, ranging from the Himalaya
through Europe to Great Britain. It is now found
wild in a few parts of England, but it is certainly not indigenous;
it was, however, very early introduced into England,
being found in all the English vocabularies of plants from
the tenth century downwards, and frequently mentioned in
the early English medical recipes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[<a href="./images/10.png">10</a>]</span>
Its names are all interesting. In the Anglo-Saxon Vocabularies
it is called <i>thung</i>, which, however, seems to have
been a general name for any very poisonous plant;<a name="FNanchor_10:1_12" id="FNanchor_10:1_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_10:1_12" class="fnanchor">[10:1]</a> it was
then called Aconite, as the English form of its Greek and
Latin name, but this name is now seldom used, being, by a
curious perversion, solely given to the pretty little early-flowering
Winter Aconite (<i>Eranthis hyemalis</i>), which is not
a true Aconite, though closely allied; it then got the name
of Wolf's-bane, as the direct translation of the Greek <i>lycoctonum</i>,
a name which it had from the idea that arrows
tipped with the juice, or baits anointed with it, would kill
wolves and other vermin; and, lastly, it got the expressive
names of Monk's-hood<a name="FNanchor_10:2_13" id="FNanchor_10:2_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_10:2_13" class="fnanchor">[10:2]</a> and the Helmet-flower, from the
curious shape of the upper sepal overtopping the rest of the
flower.</p>

<p>As to its poisonous qualities, all authors agree that every
species of the family is very poisonous, the A. ferox of the
Himalaya being probably the most so. Every part of the
plant, from the root to the pollen dust, seems to be equally
powerful, and it has the special bad quality of being, to
inexperienced eyes, so like some harmless plant, that the
poison has been often taken by mistake with deadly results.
This charge against the plant is of long standing, dating
certainly from the time of Virgil&mdash;<i>miseros fallunt aconita
legentes</i>&mdash;and, no doubt, from much before his time. As it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[<a href="./images/11.png">11</a>]</span>was a common belief that poisons were antidotes against
other poisons, the Aconite was supposed to be an antidote
against the most deadly one&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4h">"I have heard that Aconite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being timely taken hath a healing might<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the scorpion's stroke."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><span class="smcap">Ben Jonson</span>, <i>Sejanus</i>, act iii, sc. 3.</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of its poisonous qualities, the plant has
always held, and deservedly, a place among the ornamental
plants of our gardens; its stately habit and its handsome
leaves and flowers make it a favourite. Nearly all the
species are worth growing, the best, perhaps, being A. Napellus,
both white and blue, A. paniculatum, A. japonicum,
and A. autumnale. All the species grow well in shade and
under trees. In Shakespeare's time Gerard grew in his
London garden four species&mdash;A. lycoctonum, A. variegatum,
A. Napellus, and A. Pyrenaicum.</p>

<p>"An Almond for a parrot" seems to have been a proverb
for the greatest temptation that could be put before a man.
The Almond tree is a native of Asia and North Africa, but
it was very early introduced into England, probably by the
Romans. It occurs in the Anglo-Saxon lists of plants, and
in the "Durham Glossary" (11th century) it has the name
of the "Easterne nutte-beam." The tree was always a
favourite both for the beauty of its flowers, which come very
early in the year, and for its Biblical associations, so that in
Shakespeare's time the trees were "in our London gardens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[<a href="./images/12.png">12</a>]</span>and orchards in great plenty" (Gerard). Before Shakespeare's
time, Spenser had sung its praises thus&mdash;</p>

<p>and both this old name and its more modern form of
Almond came to us through the French <i>amande</i> (Proven&ccedil;al,
<i>amondala</i>), from the Greek and Latin <i>amygdalus</i>. What
this word meant is not very clear, but the native Hebrew
name of the plant (<i>shaked</i>) is most expressive. The word
signifies "awakening," and so is a most fitting name for a
tree whose beautiful flowers, appearing in Palestine in
January, show the wakening up of Creation. The fruit also
has always been a special favourite, and though it is strongly
imbued with prussic acid, it is considered a wholesome fruit.
By the old writers many wonderful virtues were attributed to
the fruit, but I am afraid it was chiefly valued for its supposed
virtue, that "five or six being taken fasting do keepe
a man from being drunke" (Gerard).<a name="FNanchor_12:1_14" id="FNanchor_12:1_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_12:1_14" class="fnanchor">[12:1]</a> This popular error
is not yet extinct.</p>

<p>As an ornamental tree the Almond should be in every
shrubbery, and, as in Gerard's time, it may still be planted
in town gardens with advantage. There are several varieties
of the common Almond, differing slightly in the colour and
size of the flowers; and there is one little shrub (Amygdalus
nana) of the family that is very pretty in the front row of a
shrubbery. All the species are deciduous.</p>

<p>Aloes have the peculiarity that they are the emblems of the
most intense bitterness and of the richest and most costly
fragrance. In the Bible Aloes are mentioned five times, and
always with reference to their excellence and costliness.<a name="FNanchor_13:1_15" id="FNanchor_13:1_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_13:1_15" class="fnanchor">[13:1]</a>
Juvenal speaks of it only as a bitter&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3h">"Animo corrupta superbo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plus Aloes quam mellis habet" (vi. 180).<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Pliny describes it very minutely, and says, "Strong it is to
smell unto, and bitter to taste" (xxvii. 4, Holland's translation).
Our old English writers spoke of it under both
aspects. It occurs in several recipes of the Anglo-Saxon
Leechdoms, as a strong and bitter purgative. Chaucer notices
its bitterness only&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Shakespeare only mentions the bitter quality.</p>

<p>The two qualities are derived from two very different
plants. The fragrant ointment is the product of an Indian
shrub, Aquilaria agallochum; and the bitter purgative is
from the true Aloes, A. Socotrina, A. vulgaris, and others.
These plants were well known in Shakespeare's time, and
were grown in England. Turner and Gerard describe them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[<a href="./images/14.png">14</a>]</span>as the Sea Houseleek; and Gerard tells us that they were
grown as vegetable curiosities, for "the herbe is alwaies
greene, and likewise sendeth forth branches, though it
remaine out of the earth, especially if the root be covered
with lome, and now and then watered; for so being hanged
on the seelings and upper posts of dining-roomes, it will not
onely continue a long time greene, but it also groweth and
bringeth forth new leaves."<a name="FNanchor_14:1_16" id="FNanchor_14:1_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_14:1_16" class="fnanchor">[14:1]</a></p>

<p>Shakespeare does not actually name the Anemone, and I
place this passage under that name with some doubt, but I
do not know any other flower to which he could be referring.</p>

<p>The original legend of the Anemone as given by Bion was
that it sprung from the tears of Venus, while the Rose sprung
from Adonis' blood&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><span class="smcap">Polwhele's</span> <i>Translation</i>, 1786.</p>

<p>But this legend was not followed by the other classical
writers, who made the Anemone to be the flower of Adonis.
Theocritus compares the Dog-rose (so called also in his day,
<ins class="greek" title="kynosbatos">&#954;&#965;&#957;&#959;&#963;&#946;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;</ins>) and the Anemone with the Rose, and the Scholia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[<a href="./images/15.png">15</a>]</span>comment on the passage thus&mdash;"Anemone, a scentless flower,
which they report to have sprung from the blood of Adonis;
and again Nicander says that the Anemone sprung from the
blood of Adonis."</p>

<p>The storehouse of our ancestors' pagan mythology was in
Ovid, and his well-known lines are&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3h">"Cum flos e sanguine concolor ortus</span><br />

<p>I feel sure that Shakespeare had some particular flower in
view. Spenser only speaks of it as a flower, and gives no
description&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In which with cunning hand was pourtrahed<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The love of Venus and her Paramoure,<br /></span>

<p>Ben Jonson similarly speaks of it as "Adonis' flower"
(Pan's Anniversary), but with Shakespeare it is different; he
describes the flower minutely, and as if it were a well-known
flower, "purple chequered with white," and considering that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[<a href="./images/16.png">16</a>]</span>in his day Anemone was supposed to be Adonis' flower
(as it was described in 1647 by Alexander Ross in his
"Mystagogus Poeticus," who says that Adonis "was by Venus
turned into a red flower called Anemone"), and as I wish,
if possible, to link the description to some special flower, I
conclude that the evidence is in favour of the Anemone.
Gerard's Anemone was certainly the same as ours, and the
"purple" colour is no objection, for "purple" in Shakespeare's
time had a very wide signification, meaning almost
any bright colour, just as <i>purpureus</i> had in Latin,<a name="FNanchor_16:1_19" id="FNanchor_16:1_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_16:1_19" class="fnanchor">[16:1]</a> which
had so wide a range that it was used on the one hand as
the epithet of the blood and the poppy, and on the other as
the epithet of the swan ("purpureis ales oloribus," Horace)
and of a woman's white arms ("brachia purpurea candidiora
nive," Albinovanus). Nor was "chequered" confined to
square divisions, as it usually is now, but included spots of
any size or shape.</p>

<p>We have transferred the Greek name of Anemone to the
English language, and we have further kept the Greek idea
in the English form of "wind-flower." The name is explained
by Pliny: "The flower hath the propertie to open
but when the wind doth blow, wherefore it took the name
Anemone in Greeke" ("Nat. Hist." xxi. 11, Holland's translation).
This, however, is not the character of the Anemone
as grown in English gardens; and so it is probable that the
name has been transferred to a different plant than the
classical one, and I think no suggestion more probable than
Dr. Prior's that the classical Anemone was the Cistus, a
shrub that is very abundant in the South of Europe; that
certainly opens its flowers at other times than when the wind
blows, and so will not well answer to Pliny's description,
but of which the flowers are bright-coloured and most fugacious,
and so will answer to Ovid's description. This
fugacious character of the Anemone is perpetuated in Sir
William Jones' lines ("Poet. Works," i, 254, ed. 1810)&mdash;</p>

<p>but the lines, though classical, are not true of the Anemone,
though they would well apply to the Cistus.<a name="FNanchor_17:1_20" id="FNanchor_17:1_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_17:1_20" class="fnanchor">[17:1]</a></p>

<p>Our English Anemones belong to a large family inhabiting
cold and temperate regions, and numbering seventy species,
of which three are British.<a name="FNanchor_17:2_21" id="FNanchor_17:2_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_17:2_21" class="fnanchor">[17:2]</a> These are A. Nemorosa, the
common wood Anemone, the brightest spring ornament of
our woods; A. Apennina, abundant in the South of Europe,
and a doubtful British plant; and A. pulsatilla, the Passe, or
Pasque flower, <i>i.e.</i>, the flower of Easter, one of the most
beautiful of our British flowers, but only to be found on the
chalk formation.</p>

<p>Here Shakespeare names the Apple, the Crab, the Pippin,
the Pomewater, the Apple-john, the Codling, the Caraway,
the Leathercoat, and the Bitter-Sweeting. Of the Apple
generally I need say nothing, except to notice that the name
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>[<a href="./images/20.png">20</a>]</span>was not originally confined to the fruit now so called, but
was a generic name applied to any fruit, as we still speak
of the Love-apple, the Pine-apple,<a name="FNanchor_20:1_22" id="FNanchor_20:1_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_20:1_22" class="fnanchor">[20:1]</a> &amp;c. The Anglo-Saxon
name for the Blackberry was the Bramble-apple; and Sir
John Mandeville, in describing the Cedars of Lebanon,
says: "And upon the hills growen Trees of Cedre, that
ben fulle hye, and they beren longe Apples, and als grete as
a man's heved"<a name="FNanchor_20:2_23" id="FNanchor_20:2_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_20:2_23" class="fnanchor">[20:2]</a> (cap. ix.). In the English Bible it is the
same. The Apple is mentioned in a few places, but it is
almost certain that it never means the Pyrus malus, but is
either the Orange, Citron, or Quince, or is a general name
for a tree fruit. So that when Shakespeare (<a href="#Apple_24">24</a>) and the
other old writers speak of Eve's Apple, they do not necessarily
assert that the fruit of the temptation was our Apple,
but simply that it was some fruit that grew in Eden. The
Apple (<i>pomum</i>) has left its mark in the language in the word
"pomatum," which, originally an ointment made of Apples,
is now an ointment in which Apples have no part.</p>

<p>The Crab was held in far more esteem in the sixteenth
century than it is with us. The roasted fruit served with hot
ale (<a href="#Apple_9">9</a> and <a href="#Apple_10">10</a>) was a favourite Christmas dish, and even
without ale the roasted Crab was a favourite, and this not for
want of better fruit, for Gerard tells us that in his time "the
stocke or kindred of Apples was infinite," but because they
were considered pleasant food.<a name="FNanchor_20:3_24" id="FNanchor_20:3_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_20:3_24" class="fnanchor">[20:3]</a> Another curious use of
Crabs is told in the description of Crab-wake, or "Crabbing
the Parson," at Halesowen, Salop, on St. Kenelm's Day
(July 17), in Brand's "Popular Antiquities" (vol. i. p. 342,
Bohn's edition). Nor may we now despise the Crab tree,
though we do not eat its fruit. Among our native trees
there is none more beautiful than the Crab tree, both in
flower and in fruit. An old Crab tree in full flower is a sight
that will delight any artist, nor is it altogether useless; its
wood is very hard and very lasting, and from its fruit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>[<a href="./images/21.png">21</a>]</span>verjuice is made, not, however, much in England, as I believe
nearly all the verjuice now used is made in France.</p>

<p>The Pippin, from being originally a general name for any
Apple raised from pips and not from grafts, is now, and
probably was in Shakespeare's time, confined to the bright-coloured,
long-keeping Apples (Justice Shallow's was "last
year's Pippin"), of which the Golden Pippin ("the Pippin
burnished o'er with gold," Phillips) is the type.</p>

<p>The Bitter-Sweeting (<a href="#Apple_22">22</a>) was an old and apparently a
favourite Apple. It is frequently mentioned in the old
writers, as by Gower, "Conf. Aman." viii. 174&mdash;</p>

<p>Parkinson names it in his list of Apples, but soon dismisses
it&mdash;"Twenty sorts of Sweetings, and none good." The
name is now given to an Apple of no great value as a table
fruit, but good as a cider apple, and for use in silk dyeing.</p>

<p>It is not easy to identify the Pomewater (<a href="#Apple_21">21</a>). It was
highly esteemed both by Shakespeare ("it hangeth like a
jewel in the ear of <i>c&oelig;lo</i>") and many other writers. In
Gerard's figure it looks like a Codling, and its Latin name
is <i>Malus carbonaria</i>, which probably refers to its good
qualities as a roasting Apple. The name Pomewater (or
Water Apple) makes us expect a juicy but not a rich Apple,
and with this agrees Parkinson's description: "The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[<a href="./images/22.png">22</a>]</span>Pomewater is an excellent, good, and great whitish Apple, full of
sap or moisture, somewhat pleasant sharp, but a little bitter
withall; it will not last long, the winter frosts soon causing
it to rot and perish." It must have been very like the
modern Lord Suffield Apple, and though Parkinson says it
will not last long, yet it is mentioned as lasting till the New
Year in a tract entitled "Vox Graculi," 1623. Speaking of
New Year's Day, the author says: "This day shall be given
many more gifts than shall be asked for; and apples, egges,
and oranges shall be lifted to a lofty rate; when a Pomewater
bestuck with a few rotten cloves shall be worth more than
the honesty of a hypocrite" (quoted by Brand, vol. i. 17,
Bohn's edition).</p>

<p>We have no such difficulty with the "dish of Apple-johns"
(<a href="#Apple_17">17</a> and <a href="#Apple_18">18</a>). Hakluyt recommends "the Apple John that
dureth two years to make show of our fruit" to be carried
by voyagers.<a name="FNanchor_22:1_27" id="FNanchor_22:1_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_22:1_27" class="fnanchor">[22:1]</a> "The Deusan (<i>deux ans</i>) or Apple-john,"
says Parkinson, "is a delicate fine fruit, well rellished when
it beginneth to be fit to be eaten, and endureth good longer
than any other Apple." With this description there is no
difficulty in identifying the Apple-john with an Apple that
goes under many names, and is figured by Maund as the
Easter Pippin. When first picked it is of a deep green
colour, and very hard. In this state it remains all the
winter, and in April or May it becomes yellow and highly
perfumed, and remains good either for cooking or dessert
for many months.</p>

<p>The Codling (<a href="#Apple_2">2</a>) is not the Apple now so called, but is the
general name of a young unripe Apple.</p>

<p>The "Leathercoats" (<a href="#Apple_19">19</a>) are the Brown Russets; and
though the "dish of Caraways" in the same passage may
refer to the Caraway or Caraway-russet Apple, an excellent
little apple, that seems to be a variety of the Nonpareil, and
has long been cultivated in England, yet it is almost certain
that it means a dish of Caraway Seeds. (<i>See</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#Carraways">Carraways</a></span>.)</p>

<p>Shakespeare's spelling of the word "Apricocks" takes us
at once to its derivation. It is derived undoubtedly from
the Latin <i>pr&aelig;cox or pr&aelig;coquus</i>, under which name it is
referred to by Pliny and Martial; but, before it became the
English Apricot it was much changed by Italians, Spaniards,
French, and Arabians. The history of the name is very
curious and interesting, but too long to give fully here; a
very good account of it may be found in Miller and in
"Notes and Queries," vol. ii. p. 420 (1850). It will be
sufficient to say here that it acquired its name of "the precocious
tree," because it flowered and fruited earlier than
the Peach, as explained in Lyte's "Herbal," 1578: "There
be two kinds of Peaches, whereof the one kinde is late ripe,
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the other kinds are soner ripe, wherefore they be called
Abrecox or Aprecox." Of its introduction into England
we have no very certain account. It was certainly grown in
England before Turner's time (1548), though he says, "We
have very few of these trees as yet;"<a name="FNanchor_23:1_28" id="FNanchor_23:1_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_23:1_28" class="fnanchor">[23:1]</a> but the only account
of its introduction is by Hakluyt, who states that it was
brought from Italy by one Wolf, gardener to King Henry
the Eighth. If that be its true history, Shakespeare was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[<a href="./images/24.png">24</a>]</span>error in putting it into the garden of the queen of Richard
the Second, nearly a hundred years before its introduction.<a name="FNanchor_24:1_29" id="FNanchor_24:1_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_24:1_29" class="fnanchor">[24:1]</a></p>

<p>In Shakespeare's time the Apricot seems to have been
grown as a standard; I gather this from the description in
Nos. <a href="#Apricot_2">2</a> (see the entire passage s.v. "<a href="#Pruning">Pruning</a>" in Part II.)
and <a href="#Apricot_3">3</a>, and from the following in Browne's "Britannia's

<p>Warwickshire is more celebrated for its Oaks and Elms
than for its Ash trees. Yet considering how common a
tree the Ash is, and in what high estimation it was held by
our ancestors, it is strange that it is only mentioned in this
one passage. Spenser spoke of it as "the Ash for nothing
ill;" it was "the husbandman's tree," from which he got
the wood for his agricultural implements; and there was
connected with it a great amount of mystic folk-lore, which
was carried to its extreme limit in the Yggdrasil, or legendary
Ash of Scandinavia, which was almost looked upon as the
parent of Creation: a full account of this may be found in
Mallet's "Northern Antiquities" and other works on Scandinavia.
It is an English native tree,<a name="FNanchor_24:3_31" id="FNanchor_24:3_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_24:3_31" class="fnanchor">[24:3]</a> and it adds much to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[<a href="./images/25.png">25</a>]</span>the beauty of any English landscape in which it is allowed
to grow. It gives its name to many places, especially in the
South, as Ashdown, Ashstead, Ashford, &amp;c.; but to see it
in its full beauty it must be seen in our northern counties,
though the finest in England is said to be at Woburn.</p>

<p>In the dales of Yorkshire it is especially beautiful, and
any one who sees the fine old trees in Wharfdale and Wensleydale
will confess that, though it may not have the rich
luxuriance of the Oaks and Elms of the southern and midland
counties, yet it has a grace and beauty that are all its
own, so that we scarcely wonder that Gilpin called it "the
Venus of the woods."</p>

<p>The Aspen or Aspe<a name="FNanchor_25:1_32" id="FNanchor_25:1_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_25:1_32" class="fnanchor">[25:1]</a> (<i>Populus tremula</i>) is one of our three
native Poplars, and has ever been the emblem of enforced
restlessness, on account of which it had in Anglo-Saxon
times the expressive name of quick-beam. How this perpetual
motion in the "light quivering Aspen" is produced
has not been quite satisfactorily explained; and the medi&aelig;val
legend that it supplied the wood of the Cross, and has
never since ceased to tremble, is still told as a sufficient
reason both in Scotland and England.</p>

<p class="authorscpoem">Mrs. Hemans.</p>

<p>The Aspen has an interesting botanical history, as being
undoubtedly, like the Scotch fir, one of the prim&aelig;val trees
of Europe; while its grey bark and leaves and its pleasant
rustling sound make the tree acceptable in our hedgerows,
but otherwise it is not a tree of much use. In Spenser's
time it was considered "good for staves;" and before his
time the tree must have been more valued than it is now,
for in the reign of Henry V. an Act of Parliament was passed
(4 Henry V. c. 3) to prevent the consumption of Aspe,
otherwise than for the making of arrows, with a penalty of
an Hundred Shillings if used for making pattens or clogs.
This Act remained in force till the reign of James I., when
it was repealed. In our own time the wood is valued for
internal panelling of rooms, and is used in the manufacture
of gunpowder.</p>

<p>By the older writers the Aspen was the favourite simile for
female loquacity. The rude libel is given at full length in
"The Schoole-house of Women" (511-545), concluding
thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Aspin lefe hanging where it be,<br /></span>

<span class="i0i">Little ease and little rest;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><span class="smcap">Hazlitt's</span> <i>Popular English Poetry</i>, vol. iv, p. 126.</p>

<p>And to the same effect Gerard concludes his account of the
tree thus: "In English Aspe and Aspen tree, and may also
be called Tremble, after the French name, considering it is
the matter whereof women's tongues were made (as the
poets and some others report), which seldom cease wagging."</p>

<p>"Though the Bachelor's Button is not exactly named by
Shakespeare, it is believed to be alluded to in this passage;
and the supposed allusion is to a rustic divination by means

<p>The true Bachelor's Button of the present day is the
double Ranunculus acris, but the name is applied very
loosely to almost any small double globular flowers. In
Shakespeare's time it was probably applied still more loosely
to any flowers in bud (according to the derivation from the
French <i>bouton</i>). Button is frequently so applied by the
old writers&mdash;</p>

<p>In all these passages, except the two last, the reference is
to the Balm or Balsam which was imported from the East,
from very early times, and was highly valued for its curative
properties. The origin of Balsam was for a long time a
secret, but it is now known to have been the produce of
several gum-bearing trees, especially the Pistacia lentiscus
and the Balsamodendron Gileadense; and now, as then,
the name is not strictly confined to the produce of any one
plant. But in Nos. <a href="#Balsam_15">15</a> and <a href="#Balsam_16">16</a> the reference is no doubt to
the Sweet Balm of the English gardens (<i>Melissa officinalis</i>),
a plant highly prized by our ancestors for its medicinal
qualities (now known to be of little value), and still valued
for its pleasant scent and its high value as a bee plant, which
is shown by its old Greek and Latin names, Melissa, Mellissophyllum,
and Apiastrum. The Bastard Balm (<i>Melittis melissophyllum</i>)
is a handsome native plant, found sparingly in
Devonshire, Hampshire, and a few other places, and is well
worth growing wherever it can be induced to grow; but it is
a very capricious plant, and is apparently not fond of garden
cultivation. "Tr&egrave;s jolie plante, mais d'une culture difficile"
(Vilmorin). It probably would thrive best in the shade, as
it is found in copses.</p>

<p>These two passages require little note. The Barley (<i>Hordeum
vulgare</i>) of Shakespeare's time and our own is the same.
We may note, however, that the Barley broth (<a href="#Barley_2">2</a>) of which
the French Constable spoke so contemptuously as the food
of English soldiers was probably beer, which long before the
time of Henry V. was so celebrated that it gave its name to
the plant (Barley being simply the Beer-plant), and in
Shakespeare's time, "though strangers never heard of such
a word or such a thing, by reason it is not everyewhere
made," yet "our London Beere-Brewers would scorne to
learne to make beere of either French or Dutch" (Gerard).</p>

<p>It may seem absurd to include Barnacles among plants;
but in the time of Shakespeare the Barnacle tree was firmly
believed in, and Gerard gives a plate of "the Goose tree,
Barnacle tree, or the tree bearing Geese," and says that he
declares "what our eies have seene, and our hands have
touched."</p>

<p>A full account of the fable will be found in Harting's
"Ornithology of Shakespeare," p. 247, and an excellent account
in Lee's "Sea Fables Explained" (Fisheries Exhibition
handbooks), p. 98. But neither of these writers have quoted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[<a href="./images/31.png">31</a>]</span>the testimony of Sir John Mandeville, which is, however,
well worth notice. When he was told in "Caldilhe" of
a tree that bore "a lytylle Best in Flessche in Bon and
Blode as though it were a lytylle Lomb, withouten Wolle,"
he did not refuse to believe them, for he says, "I tolde hem
of als gret a marveylle to hem that is amonges us; and that
was of the Bernakes. For I tolde hem, that in our Contree

<p>It is not easy to determine what tree is meant in these
passages. In the first there is little doubt that Shakespeare
copied from some Italian source the superstition that the
Bay trees in a country withered and died when any great
calamity was approaching. We have no proof that such an
idea ever prevailed in England. In the second passage
reference is made to the decking of the chief dish at high
feasts with garlands of flowers and evergreens. But the Bay
tree had been too recently introduced from the South of
Europe in Shakespeare's time to be so used to any great
extent, though the tree was known long before, for it is mentioned
in the Anglo-Saxon Vocabularies by the name of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[<a href="./images/32.png">32</a>]</span>Beay-beam, that is, the Coronet tree;<a name="FNanchor_32:1_35" id="FNanchor_32:1_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_32:1_35" class="fnanchor">[32:1]</a> but whether the Beay-beam
meant our Bay tree is very uncertain. We are not
much helped in the inquiry by the notice of the "flourishing
green Bay tree" in the Psalms, for it seems very certain that
the Bay tree there mentioned is either the Oleander or the
Cedar, certainly not the Laurus nobilis.</p>

<p>The true Bay is probably mentioned by Spenser in the
following lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Bay, quoth she, is of the victours born,<br /></span>

<span class="i0i">To sing the glory of their famous deeds."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Amoretti</i>&mdash;Sonnet xxix.</p>

<p>And in the following passage (written in the lifetime
of Shakespeare) the Laurel and the Bay are both named as
the same tree&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And when from Daphne's tree he plucks more Baies<br /></span>

<p>In the present day no garden of shrubs can be considered
complete without the Bay tree, both the common one and
especially the Californian Bay (<i>Oreodaphne Californica</i>),
which, with its bright green lanceolate foliage and powerful
aromatic scent (to some too pungent), deserves a place
everywhere, and it is not so liable to be cut by the spring
winds as the European Bay.<a name="FNanchor_32:2_36" id="FNanchor_32:2_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_32:2_36" class="fnanchor">[32:2]</a> Parkinson's high praise of
the Bay tree (forty years after Shakespeare's death) is too
long for insertion, but two short sentences may be quoted:
"The Bay leaves are of as necessary use as any other in
the garden or orchard, for they serve both for pleasure and
profit, both for ornament and for use, both for honest civil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[<a href="./images/33.png">33</a>]</span>uses and for physic, yea, both for the sick and for the sound,
both for the living and for the dead; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so that from the
cradle to the grave we have still use of it, we have still need
of it."</p>

<p>The Bay tree gives us a curious instance of the capriciousness
of English plant names. Though a true Laurel
it does not bear the name, which yet is given to two trees,
the common (and Portugal) Laurel, and the Laurestinus,
neither of which are Laurels&mdash;the one being a Cherry or
Plum (<i>Prunus</i> or <i>Cerasus</i>), the other a Guelder Rose
(<i>Viburnum</i>).<a name="FNanchor_33:1_37" id="FNanchor_33:1_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_33:1_37" class="fnanchor">[33:1]</a></p>

<p>The Bean (<i>Faba vulgaris</i>), though an Eastern plant, was
very early introduced into England as an article of food
both for men and horses. As an article of human food
opinions were divided, as now. By some it was highly
esteemed&mdash;</p>

<p>It is not apparently a romantic plant, and yet there is no
plant round which so much curious folk lore has gathered.
This may be seen at full length in Phillips' "History of
Cultivated Vegetables." It will be enough here to say
that the Bean was considered as a sacred plant both by the
Greeks and Romans, while by the Egyptian priests it was
considered too unclean to be even looked upon; that it
was used both for its convenient shape and for its sacred
associations in all elections by ballot; that this custom
lasted in England and in most Europeans countries to a
very recent date in the election of the kings and queens at
Twelfth Night and other feasts; and that it was of great
repute in all popular divinations and love charms. I find
in Miller another use of Beans, which we are thankful to
note among the obsolete uses: "They are bought up in
great quantities at Bristol for Guinea ships, as food for the
negroes on their passage from Africa to the West Indies."</p>

<p>As an ornamental garden plant the Bean has never
received the attention it seems to deserve. A plant of
Broad Beans grown singly is quite a stately plant, and the
rich scent is an additional attraction to many, though to
many others it is too strong, and it has a bad character&mdash;"Sleep
in a Bean-field all night if you want to have awful
dreams or go crazy," is a Leicestershire proverb:<a name="FNanchor_34:3_40" id="FNanchor_34:3_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_34:3_40" class="fnanchor">[34:3]</a> and the
Scarlet Runner (which is also a Bean) is one of the most
beautiful climbers we have. In England we seldom grow it
for ornament, but in France I have seen it used with excellent
effect to cover a trellis-screen, mixed with the large blue
Convolvulus major.</p>

<p>The Bilberry is a common British shrub found on all
mossy heaths, and very pretty both in flower and in fruit.
Its older English name was Heathberry, and its botanical
name is Vaccinium myrtillus. We have in Britain four
species of Vaccinium: the Whortleberry or Bilberry (<i>V.
myrtillus</i>), the Large Bilberry (<i>V. uliginosum</i>), the Crowberry
(<i>V. vitis id&aelig;a</i>), and the Cranberry (<i>V. oxycoccos</i>). These
British species, as well as the North American species (of
which there are several), are all beautiful little shrubs in
cultivation, but they are very difficult to grow; they require
a heathy soil, moisture, and partial shade.</p>

<p>Shakespeare only mentions this one unpleasant use of
the Birch tree, the manufacture of Birch rods; and for
such it seems to have been chiefly valued in his day. "I
have not red of any vertue it hath in physick," says Turner;
"howbeit, it serveth for many good uses, and for none
better than for betynge of stubborn boys, that either lye
or will not learn." Yet the Birch is not without interest.
The word "Birch" is the same as "bark," meaning first
the rind of a tree and then a barque or boat (from which
we also get our word "barge"), and so the very name carries
us to those early times when the Birch was considered one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[<a href="./images/36.png">36</a>]</span>of the most useful of trees, as it still is in most northern
countries, where it grows at a higher degree of latitude than
any other tree. Its bark was especially useful, being useful
for cordage, and matting, and roofing, while the tree itself
formed the early British canoes, as it still forms the canoes
of the North American Indians, for which it is well suited,
from its lightness and ease in working.</p>

<p>In Northern Europe it is the most universal and the most
useful of trees. It is "the superlative tree in respect of the
ground it covers, and in the variety of purposes to which it
is converted in Lapland, where the natives sit in birchen
huts on birchen chairs, wearing birchen boots and breeches,
with caps and capes of the same material, warming themselves
by fires of birchwood charcoal, reading books bound
in birch, and eating herrings from a birchen platter, pickled
in a birchen cask. Their baskets, boats, harness, and
utensils are all of Birch; in short, from cradle to coffin, the
Birch forms the peculiar environment of the Laplander."<a name="FNanchor_36:1_41" id="FNanchor_36:1_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_36:1_41" class="fnanchor">[36:1]</a>
In England we still admire its graceful beauty, whether it
grows in our woods or our gardens, and we welcome its
pleasant odour on our Russia leather bound books; but we
have ceased to make beer from its young shoots,<a name="FNanchor_36:2_42" id="FNanchor_36:2_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_36:2_42" class="fnanchor">[36:2]</a> and we
hold it in almost as low repute (from the utilitarian point of
view) as Turner and Shakespeare seem to have held it.</p>

<p>I here join together the tree and the fruit, the Bramble
(<i>Rubus fruticosus</i>) and the Blackberry. There is not much
to be said for a plant that is the proverbial type of a barren
country or untidy cultivation, yet the Bramble and the Blackberry
have their charms, and we could ill afford to lose them
from our hedgerows. The name Bramble originally meant
anything thorny, and Chaucer applied it to the Dog Rose&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He was chaste and no lechour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And sweet as is the Bramble flower<br /></span>
<span class="i1i">That bereth the red hepe."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But in Shakespeare's time it was evidently confined to the
Blackberry-bearing Bramble.</p>

<p>There is a quaint legend of the origin of the plant which
is worth repeating. It is thus pleasantly told by Waterton:
"The cormorant was once a wool merchant. He entered
into partnership with the Bramble and the bat, and they
freighted a large ship with wool; she was wrecked, and the
firm became bankrupt. Since that disaster the bat skulks
about till midnight to avoid his creditors, the cormorant is
for ever diving into the deep to discover its foundered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>[<a href="./images/38.png">38</a>]</span>vessel, while the Bramble seizes hold of every passing sheep
to make up his loss by stealing the wool."</p>

<p>As a garden plant, the common Bramble had better be
kept out of the garden, but there are double pink and
white-blossomed varieties, and others with variegated leaves,
that are handsome plants on rough rockwork. The little
Rubus saxatilis is a small British Bramble that is pretty on
rockwork, and among the foreign Brambles there are some
that should on no account be omitted where ornamental
shrubs are grown. Such are the R. leucodermis from
Nepaul, with its bright silvery bark and amber-coloured
fruit; R. Nootkanus, with very handsome foliage, and
pure white rose-like flowers; R. Arcticus, an excellent rockwork
plant from Northern Europe, with very pleasant fruit,
but difficult to establish; R. Australis (from New Zealand), a
most quaint plant, with leaves so depauperated that it is
apparently leafless, and hardy in the South of England; and
R. deliciosus, a very handsome plant from the Rocky Mountains.
There are several others well worth growing, but I
mention these few to show that the Bramble is not altogether
such a villainous and useless weed as it is proverbially
supposed to be.</p>

<p>The Box is a native British tree, and in the sixteenth
century was probably much more abundant as a wild tree
than it is now. Chaucer notes it as a dismal tree. He
describes Palamon in his misery as&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4h">"Like was he to byholde,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Boxe tree or the Asschen deed and colde."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>The Knightes Tale.</i></p>

<p>Spenser noted it as "The Box yet mindful of his olde
offence," and in Shakespeare's time there were probably more
woods of Box in England than the two which still remain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[<a href="./images/39.png">39</a>]</span>at Box Hill, in Surrey, and Boxwell, in Gloucestershire.
The name remains, though the trees are gone, in Box in
Wilts, Boxgrove, Boxley, Boxmoor, Boxted, and Boxworth.<a name="FNanchor_39:1_44" id="FNanchor_39:1_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_39:1_44" class="fnanchor">[39:1]</a>
From its wild quarters the Box tree was very early brought
into gardens, and was especially valued, not only for its rich
evergreen colour, but because, with the Yew, it could be
cut and tortured into all the ungainly shapes which so delighted
our ancestors in Shakespeare's time, though one of
the most illustrious of them, Lord Bacon, entered his protest
against such barbarisms: "I, for my part, do not like
images cut out in Juniper or other garden stuff; they be for
children" ("Essay of Gardens").</p>

<p>The chief use of the Box now is for blocks for wood-carving,
for which its close grain makes it the most suitable
of all woods.<a name="FNanchor_39:2_45" id="FNanchor_39:2_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_39:2_45" class="fnanchor">[39:2]</a></p>

<p>In Shakespeare's time the "Brier" was not restricted
to the Sweet Briar, as it usually is now; but it meant any
sort of wild Rose, and even it would seem from No. <a href="#Brier_9">9</a> that
it was applied to the cultivated Rose, for there the scene is
laid in the Temple Gardens. In some of the passages it
probably does not allude to any Rose, but simply to any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[<a href="./images/41.png">41</a>]</span>wild thorny plant. That this was its common use then, we
know from many examples. In "Le Morte Arthur," the

<p>The Broom was one of the most popular plants of the
Middle Ages. Its modern Latin name is <i>Cytisus scoparius</i>,
but under its then Latin name of <i>Planta genista</i> it gave its
name to the Plantagenet family, either in the time of Henry
II., as generally reported, or probably still earlier. As the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[<a href="./images/42.png">42</a>]</span>favourite badge of the family it appears on their monuments
and portraits, and was embroidered on their clothes
and imitated in their jewels. Nor was it only in England
that the plant was held in such high favour; it was the
special flower of the Scotch, and it was highly esteemed in
many countries on the Continent, especially in Brittany.
Yet, in spite of all this, there are only these three notices of
the plant in Shakespeare, and of those three, two (<a href="#Broom_2">2</a> and <a href="#Broom_3">3</a>)
refer to its uses when dead; and the third (<a href="#Broom_1">1</a>), though it
speaks of it as living, yet has nothing to say of the remarkable
beauties of this favourite British flower. Yet it has
great beauties which cannot easily be overlooked. Its
large, yellow flowers, its graceful habit of growth, and its
fragrance&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sweet is the Broome-flowre, but yet sowre enough"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><span class="smcap">Spenser</span>, <i>Sonnet</i> xxvi.</p>

<p>at once arrest the attention of the most careless observer of
Nature. We are almost driven to the conclusion that
Shakespeare could not have had much real acquaintance
with the Broom, or he would not have sent his "dismissed
bachelor" to "Broom-groves."<a name="FNanchor_42:1_47" id="FNanchor_42:1_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_42:1_47" class="fnanchor">[42:1]</a> I should very much doubt
that the Broom could ever attain to the dimensions of a
grove, though Steevens has a note on the passage that
"near Gamlingay, in Cambridgeshire, it grows high enough
to conceal the tallest cattle as they pass through it; and in
places where it is cultivated still higher." Chaucer speaks
of the Broom, but does not make it so much of a tree&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Amid the Broom he basked in the sun."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And other poets have spoken of the Broom in the same
way&mdash;thus Collins&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0i">Amid the Broom he basked him on the ground."<br /></span>

<p>And a Russian poet speaks of the Broom as a tree&mdash;</p>

<p>As a garden plant it is perhaps seen to best advantage
when mixed with other shrubs, as when grown quite by
itself it often has an untidy look. There is a pure white
variety which is very beautiful, but it is very liable to flower
so abundantly as to flower itself to death. There are a few
other sorts, but none more beautiful than the British.</p>

<p>The Burs are the unopened flowers of the Burdock
(<i>Arctium lappa</i>), and their clinging quality very early obtained
for them expressive names, such as <i>amor folia</i>, love
leaves, and philantropium. This clinging quality arises
from the bracts of the involucrum being long and stiff, and
with hooked tips which attach themselves to every passing
object. The Burdock is a very handsome plant when seen
in its native habitat by the side of a brook, its broad leaves
being most picturesque, but it is not a plant to introduce
into a garden.<a name="FNanchor_44:1_48" id="FNanchor_44:1_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_44:1_48" class="fnanchor">[44:1]</a> There is another tribe of plants, however,
which are sufficiently ornamental to merit a place in the
garden, and whose Burs are even more clinging than those
of the Burdock. These are the Ac&aelig;nas; they are mostly
natives of America and New Zealand, and some of
them (especially A. sarmentosa and A. microphylla) form
excellent carpet plants, but their points being furnished with
double hooks, like a double-barbed arrow, they have double
powers of clinging.</p>

<p>The Burnet (<i>Poterium sanguisorba</i>) is a native plant of
no great beauty or horticultural interest, but it was valued
as a good salad plant, the leaves tasting of Cucumber, and
Lord Bacon (contemporary with Shakespeare) seems to have
been especially fond of it. He says ("Essay of Gardens"):</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[<a href="./images/45.png">45</a>]</span>
"Those flowers which perfume the air most delightfully, not
passed by as the rest, but being trodden upon and crushed,
are three&mdash;that is, Burnet, Wild Thyme, and Water Mints;
therefore you are to set whole alleys of them, to have the
pleasure when you walk or tread." Drayton had the same
affection for it&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0i">Whose leaf I greatly fancy."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Nymphal V.</i></p>

<p>It also was, and still is, valued as a forage plant that will
grow and keep fresh all the winter in dry barren pastures,
thus often giving food for sheep when other food was
scarce. It has occasionally been cultivated, but the result
has not been very satisfactory, except on very poor land,
though, according to the Woburn experiments, as reported
by Sinclair, it contains a larger amount of nutritive matter
in the spring than most of the Grasses. It has brown
flowers, from which it is supposed to derive its name
(Brunetto).<a name="FNanchor_45:1_49" id="FNanchor_45:1_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_45:1_49" class="fnanchor">[45:1]</a></p>

<p>The history of the name is rather curious. It comes to
us from the French <i>Chou cabus</i>, which is the French corruption
of <i>Caulis capitatus</i>, the name by which Pliny described
it.</p>

<p>The Cabbage of Shakespeare's time was essentially the
same as ours, and from the contemporary accounts it seems
that the sorts cultivated were as good and as numerous as
they are now. The cultivated Cabbage is the same specifically
as the wild Cabbage of our sea-shores (<i>Brassica
oleracea</i>) improved by cultivation. Within the last few
years the Cabbage has been brought from the kitchen garden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>[<a href="./images/46.png">46</a>]</span>into the flower garden on account of the beautiful
variegation of its leaves. This, however, is no novelty, for
Parkinson said of the many sorts of Cabbage in his day:
"There is greater diversity in the form and colour of the
leaves of this plant than there is in any other that I know
groweth on the ground.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Many of them being of no
use with us for the table, but for delight to behold the
wonderful variety of the works of God herein."</p>

<p>The low-growing Camomile, the emblem of the sweetness
of humility, has the lofty names of Camomile (<i>Cham&aelig;melum</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, Apple of the Earth) and Anthemis nobilis. Its
fine aromatic scent and bitter flavour suggested that it must
be possessed of much medicinal virtue, while its low growth
made it suitable for planting on the edges of flower-beds and
paths, its scent being brought out as it was walked upon.
For this purpose it was much used in Elizabethan gardens;
"large walks, broad and long, close and open, like the
Tempe groves in Thessaly, raised with gravel and sand,
having seats and banks of Camomile; all this delights the
mind, and brings health to the body."<a name="FNanchor_46:1_50" id="FNanchor_46:1_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_46:1_50" class="fnanchor">[46:1]</a> As a garden flower
it is now little used, though its bright starry flower and fine
scent might recommend it; but it is still to be found in herb
gardens, and is still, though not so much as formerly, used
as a medicine.</p>

<p>Like many other low plants, the Camomile is improved
by being pressed into the earth by rolling or otherwise, and
there are many allusions to this in the old writers: thus
Lily in his "Euphues" says: "The Camomile the more it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[<a href="./images/47.png">47</a>]</span>is trodden and pressed down, the more it spreadeth;" and

<p>Dr. Johnson and others have supposed that the flower is
so named from the colour, but that this is a mistake is made
very clear by Dr. Prior. He quotes Spenser's "Shepherd's
Calendar"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bring Coronations and Sops-in-Wine<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Worn of Paramours."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and so it is spelled in Lyte's "Herbal," 1578, coronations
or cornations. This takes us at once to the origin of the
name. The plant was one of those used in garlands (<i>coron&aelig;</i>),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[<a href="./images/48.png">48</a>]</span>and was probably one of the most favourite plants used
for that purpose, for which it was well suited by its shape
and beauty. Pliny gives a long list of garland flowers
(<i>Coronamentorum genera</i>) used by the Romans and Athenians,
and Nicander gives similar lists of Greek garland
plants (<ins class="greek" title="stephan&ocirc;matika anth&ecirc;">&#963;&#964;&#949;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#969;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8048; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#951;</ins>), in which the Carnation holds so
high a place that it was called by the name it still has&mdash;Dianthus,
or Flower of Jove.</p>

<p>Its second specific name, Caryophyllus&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Nut-leaved&mdash;seems
at first very inappropriate for a grassy leaved plant,
but the name was first given to the Indian Clove-tree, and
from it transferred to the Carnation, on account of its fine
clove-like scent. Its popularity as an English plant is shown
by its many names&mdash;Pink, Carnation, Gilliflower<a name="FNanchor_48:1_51" id="FNanchor_48:1_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_48:1_51" class="fnanchor">[48:1]</a> (an
easily-traced and well-ascertained corruption from Caryophyllus),
Clove, Picotee,<a name="FNanchor_48:2_52" id="FNanchor_48:2_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_48:2_52" class="fnanchor">[48:2]</a> and Sops-in-Wine, from the
flowers being used to flavour wine and beer.<a name="FNanchor_48:3_53" id="FNanchor_48:3_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_48:3_53" class="fnanchor">[48:3]</a> There is an
historical interest also in the flowers. All our Carnations,
Picotees, and Cloves come originally from the single Dianthus
caryophyllus; this is not a true British plant, but it
holds a place in the English flora, being naturalized on
Rochester and other castles. It is abundant in Normandy,
and I found it (in 1874) covering the old castle of Falaise
in which William the Conqueror was born. Since that I
have found that it grows on the old castles of Dover, Deal,
and Cardiff, all of them of Norman construction, as was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[<a href="./images/49.png">49</a>]</span>Rochester, which was built by Gundulf, the special friend of
William. Its occurrence on these several Norman castles
make it very possible that it was introduced by the Norman
builders, perhaps as a pleasant memory of their Norman
homes, though it may have been accidentally introduced
with the Normandy (Caen) stone, of which parts of the
castles are built. How soon it became a florist's flower we
do not know, but it must have been early, as in Shakespeare's
time the sorts of Cloves, Carnations, and Pinks
were so many that Gerard says: "A great and large volume
would not suffice to write of every one at large in particular,
considering how infinite they are, and how every yeare,
every clymate and countrey, bringeth forth new sorts, and
such as have not heretofore bin written of;" and so we may
certainly say now&mdash;the description of the many kinds of
Carnations and Picotees, with directions for their culture,
would fill a volume.</p>

<p>Carraways are the fruit of Carum carui, an umbelliferous
plant of a large geographical range, cultivated in the eastern
counties, and apparently wild in other parts of England,
but not considered a true native. In Shakespeare's time the
seed was very popular, and was much more freely used than
in our day. "The seed," says Parkinson, "is much used
to be put among baked fruit, or into bread, cakes, &amp;c., to
give them a rellish. It is also made into comfits and put
into Trageas or (as we call them in English) Dredges, that
are taken for cold or wind in the body, as also are served
to the table with fruit."</p>

<p>Carraways are frequently mentioned in the old writers as
an accompaniment to Apples. In a very interesting bill of
fare of 1626, extracted from the account book of Sir Edward
Dering, is the following&mdash;</p>

<p>Dame Quickly's pun gives us our Carrot, a plant which,
originally derived from our wild Carrot (<i>Daucus Carota</i>), was
introduced as a useful vegetable by the Flemings in the time
of Elizabeth, and has probably been very little altered or
improved since the time of its introduction. In Shakespeare's
time the name was applied to the "Yellow Carrot"
or Parsnep, as well as to the Red one. The name of Carrot
comes directly from its Latin or rather Greek name, Daucus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>[<a href="./images/51.png">51</a>]</span>Carota, but it once had a prettier name. The Anglo-Saxons
called it "bird's-nest," and Gerard gives us the reason, and
it is a reason that shows they were more observant of the
habits of plants than we generally give them credit for:
"The whole tuft (of flowers) is drawn together when the seed
is ripe, resembling a bird's nest; whereupon it hath been
named of some Bird's-nest."</p>

<p>The Cedar is the classical type of majesty and grandeur,
and superiority to everything that is petty and mean. So
Shakespeare uses it, and only in this way; for it is very
certain he never saw a living specimen of the Cedar of
Lebanon. But many travellers in the East had seen it and
minutely described it, and from their descriptions he derived
his knowledge of the tree; but not only, and probably not
chiefly from travellers, for he was well acquainted with his
Bible, and there he would meet with many a passage that
dwelt on the glories of the Cedar, and told how it was the
king of trees, so that "the Fir trees were not like his boughs,
and the Chestnut trees were not like his branches, nor any
tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty,
fair by the multitude of his branches, so that all the trees
of Eden that were in the garden of God envied him"
(Ezekiel xxxi. 8, 9). It was such descriptions as these that
supplied Shakespeare with his imagery, and which made our
ancestors try to introduce the tree into England. But there
seems to have been much difficulty in establishing it. Evelyn
tried to introduce it, but did not succeed at first, and the
tree is not mentioned in his "Sylva" of 1664. It was,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[<a href="./images/53.png">53</a>]</span>however, certainly introduced in 1676, when it appears,
from the gardeners' accounts, to have been planted at
Bretby Park, Derbyshire ("Gardener's Chronicle," January,
1877). I believe this is the oldest certain record of the
planting of the Cedar in England, the next oldest being
the trees in Chelsea Botanic Gardens, which were certainly
planted in 1683. Since that time the tree has proved so
suitable to the English soil that it is grown everywhere, and
everywhere asserts itself as the king of evergreen trees,
whether grown as a single tree on a lawn, or mixed in large
numbers with other trees, as at Highclere Park, in Hampshire
(Lord Carnarvon's). Among English Cedar trees
there are probably none that surpass the fine specimens at
Warwick Castle, which owe, however, much of their beauty
to their position on the narrow strip of land between the
Castle and the river. I mention these to call attention
to the pleasant coincidence (for it is nothing more) that
the most striking descriptions of the Cedar are given by
Shakespeare to the then owner of the princely Castle of
Warwick (Nos. <a href="#Cedar_3">3</a> and <a href="#Cedar_4">4</a>).</p>

<p>The medi&aelig;val belief about the Cedar was that its wood
was imperishable. "H&aelig;c Cedrus, A<sup>e</sup> sydyretre, et est talis
nature quod nunquam putrescet in aqua nec in terra"
(English Vocabulary&mdash;15th cent.); but as a timber tree
the English-grown Cedar has not answered to its old reputation,
so that Dr. Lindley called it "the worthless though
magnificent Cedar of Lebanon."</p>

the authority of Pliny that the Cherry (<i>Prunus Cerasus</i>)

was introduced into Britain. It is not, then, a true native,
but it has now become completely naturalized in our woods

favourites for the beauty of their flowers, and their rich and
handsome fruit. In Shakespeare's time there were almost
as many, and probably as good varieties, as there are now.</p>

<p>This is the Spanish or Sweet Chestnut, a fruit which
seems to have been held in high esteem in Shakespeare's
time, for Lyte, in 1578, says of it, "Amongst all kindes of
wilde fruites the Chestnut is best and meetest for to be
eaten." The tree cannot be regarded as a true native, but
it has been so long introduced, probably by the Romans,
that grand specimens are to be found in all parts of England;
the oldest known specimen being at Tortworth, in
Gloucestershire, which was spoken of as an old tree in
the time of King Stephen; while the tree that is said to be
the oldest and the largest in Europe is the Spanish Chestnut
tree on Mount Etna, the famous Castagni du Centu Cavalli,
which measures near the root 160 feet in circumference.
It is one of our handsomest trees, and very useful for timber,
and at one time it was supposed that many of our oldest
buildings were roofed with Chestnut. This was the current
report of the grand roof at Westminster Hall, but it is now
discovered to be of Oak, and it is very doubtful whether the
Chestnut timber is as lasting as it has long been supposed to be.</p>

<p>The Horse Chestnut was probably unknown to Shakespeare.
It is an Eastern tree, and in no way related to the
true Chestnut, and though the name has probably no connection
with horses or their food, yet it is curious that the
petiole has (especially when dry) a marked resemblance to a
horse's leg and foot, and that both on the parent stem and
the petiole may be found a very correct representation of a
horseshoe with its nails.<a name="FNanchor_55:1_58" id="FNanchor_55:1_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_55:1_58" class="fnanchor">[55:1]</a></p>

<p>"Honey-stalks" are supposed to be the flower of the
Clover. This seems very probable, but I believe the name
is no longer applied. Of the Clover there are two points of
interest that are worth notice. The Clover is one of the
plants that claim to be the Shamrock of St. Patrick. This
is not a settled point, and at the present day the Woodsorrel
is supposed to have the better claim to the honour. But it
is certain that the Clover is the "clubs" of the pack of
cards. "Clover" is a corruption of "Clava," a club. In
England we paint the Clover on our cards and call it
"clubs," while in France they have the same figure, but
call it "trefle."</p>

<p>In Shakespeare's time the word "Cockle" was becoming
restricted to the Corn-cockle (<i>Lychnis githago</i>), but both in
his time, and certainly in that of the writers before him,
it was used generally for any noxious weed that grew in
corn-fields, and was usually connected with the Darnel and
Tares.<a name="FNanchor_57:1_60" id="FNanchor_57:1_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_57:1_60" class="fnanchor">[57:1]</a> So Gower&mdash;</p>

<p>The Cockle or Campion is said to do mischief among the
Wheat, not only, as the Poppy and other weeds, by occupying

mixed with the corn, and then "what hurt it doth among
corne, the spoyle unto bread, as well in colour, taste, and
unwholsomness is better known than desired." So says
Gerard, but I do not know how far modern experience
confirms him. It is a pity the plant has so bad a character,
for it is a very handsome weed, with a fine blue flower, and
the seeds are very curious objects under the microscope,
being described as exactly like a hedgehog rolled up.<a name="FNanchor_58:1_61" id="FNanchor_58:1_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_58:1_61" class="fnanchor">[58:1]</a></p>

<p>The Coloquintida, or Colocynth, is the dried fleshy part of
the fruit of the Cucumis or Citrullus colocynthis. As a drug
it was imported in Shakespeare's time and long before, but
he may also have known the plant. Gerard seems to have
grown it, though from his describing it as a native of the
sandy shores of the Mediterranean, he perhaps confused it
with the Squirting Cucumber (<i>Momordica elaterium</i>). It
is a native of Turkey, but has been found also in Japan.
It is also found in the East, and we read of it in the
history of Elisha: "One went out into the field to gather
herbs, and found a wild Vine, and gathered thereof wild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>[<a href="./images/59.png">59</a>]</span>Gourds, his lap full."<a name="FNanchor_59:1_62" id="FNanchor_59:1_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_59:1_62" class="fnanchor">[59:1]</a> It is not quite certain what species
of Gourd is here meant, but all the old commentators considered
it to be the Colocynth,<a name="FNanchor_59:2_63" id="FNanchor_59:2_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_59:2_63" class="fnanchor">[59:2]</a> the word "vine" meaning
any climbing plant, a meaning that is still in common use
in America.</p>

<p>All the tribe of Cucumbers are handsome foliaged plants,
but they require room. On the Continent they are much
more frequently grown in gardens than in England, but the
hardy perennial Cucumber (<i>Cucumis perennis</i>) makes a very
handsome carpet where the space can be spared, and the
Squirting Cucumber (also hardy and perennial) is worth
growing for its curious fruit. (<i>See also</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#Pumpion">Pumpion</a></span>.)</p>

<p>This brings us to one of the most favourite of our old-fashioned
English flowers. It is very doubtful whether it is
a true native, but from early times it has been "carefully
nursed up in our gardens for the delight both of its forme
and colours" (Parkinson); yet it had a bad character, as we
see from two passages quoted by Steevens&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What's that&mdash;a Columbine?<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">No! that thankless flower grows not in my garden."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>All Fools</i>, by <span class="smcap">Chapman</span>, 1605.</p>

<p>and again in the 15th Song of Drayton's "Polyolbion"&mdash;</p>

<p>
"The Columbine amongst they sparingly do set."<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>[<a href="./images/60.png">60</a>]</span>
Spenser gave it a better character. Among his "gardyn of
sweet floures, that dainty odours from them threw around,"
he places&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Her neck lyke to a bounch of Cullambynes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And, still earlier, Skelton (1463-1529) spoke of it with high
praise&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"She is the Vyolet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The Daysy delectable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The Columbine commendable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The Ielofer amyable."&mdash;<i>Phyllip Sparrow.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Both the English and the Latin names are descriptive of
the plant. Columbine, or the Dove-plant, calls our attention
to the "resemblance of its nectaries to the heads of
pigeons in a ring round a dish, a favourite device of ancient
artists" (Dr. Prior); or to "the figure of a hovering dove
with expanded wings, which we obtain by pulling off a
single petal with its attached sepals" (Lady Wilkinson);
though it may also have had some reference to the colour,
as the word is used by Chaucer&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come forth now with thin eyghen Columbine."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>The Marchaundes Tale</i> (190).</p>

<p>The Latin name, <i>Aquilegia</i>, is generally supposed to come
from <i>aquilegus</i>, a water-collector, alluding to the water-holding
powers of the flower; it may, however, be derived
from <i>aquila</i>, an eagle, but this seems more doubtful.</p>

<p>As a favourite garden flower, the Columbine found its
way into heraldic blazonry. "It occurs in the crest of the
old Barons Grey of Vitten, as may be seen in the garter coat
of William Grey of Vitten" (Camden Society 1847), and is
thus described in the Painter's bill for the ceremonial of the
funeral of William Lord Grey of Vitten (MS. Coll. of Arms,
i, 13, fol. 35a): "Item, his creste with the favron, or, sette
on a leftehande glove, argent, out thereof issuyinge, caste
over threade, a braunch of Collobyns, blue, the stalk vert."
Old Gwillim also enumerates the Columbine among his
"Coronary Herbs," as follows: "He beareth argent, a
chevron sable between three Columbines slipped proper, by
the name of Hall of Coventry. The Columbine is pleasing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[<a href="./images/61.png">61</a>]</span>to the eye, as well in respect of the seemly (and not vulgar)
shape as in regard of the azury colour thereof, and is holden
to be very medicinable for the dissolving of imposthumations
or swellings in the throat."</p>

<p>As a garden plant the Columbine still holds a favourite
place. Hardy, handsome, and easy of cultivation, it commends
itself to the most ornamental as well as to the cottage
garden, and there are so many different sorts (both species
and varieties) that all tastes may be suited. Of the common
species (A. vulgaris) there are double and single, blue, white,
and red; there is the beautiful dwarf A. Pyrenaica, never
exceeding six inches in height, but of a very rich deep blue;
there are the red and yellow ones (A. Skinneri and A. formosa)
from North America; and, to mention no more, there
are the lovely A. c&oelig;rulea and the grand A. chrysantha from
the Rocky Mountains, certainly two of the most desirable
acquisitions to our hardy flowers that we have had in late
years.</p>

<p>It is most probable that Shakespeare had no further
acquaintance with the Cork tree than his use of Corks. The
living tree was not introduced into England till the latter
part of the seventeenth century, yet is very fairly described
both by Gerard and Parkinson. The Cork, however, was
largely imported, and was especially used for shoes. Not
only did "shoemakers put it in shoes and pantofles for
warmness sake," but for its lightness it was used for the high-heeled
shoes of the fashionable ladies. I suppose from the
following lines that these shoes were a distinguishing part of
a bride's trousseau&mdash;</p>

<p>The Cork tree is a necessary element in all botanic gardens,
but as an ornamental tree it is not sufficiently distinct from
the Ilex. Though a native of the South of Europe it is
hardy in England.</p>

<p>"Cowslips! how the children love them, and go out into
the fields on the sunny April mornings to collect them in
their little baskets, and then come home and pick the pips
to make sweet unintoxicating wine, preserving at the same
time untouched a bunch of the goodliest flowers as a harvest-sheaf
of beauty! and then the white soft husks are gathered
into balls and tossed from hand to hand till they drop to
pieces, to be trodden upon and forgotten. And so at last,
when each sense has had its fill of the flower, and they are
thoroughly tired of their play, the children rest from their
celebration of the Cowslip. Blessed are such flowers that
appeal to every sense." So wrote Dr. Forbes Watson in his
very pretty and Ruskinesque little work "Flowers and
Gardens," and the passage well expresses one of the chief
charms of the Cowslip. It is the most favourite wild flower
with children. It must have been also a favourite with
Shakespeare, for his descriptions show that he had studied
it with affection. The minute description in (<a href="#Cowslip_6">6</a>) should be
noticed. The upright golden Cowslip is compared to one
of Queen Elizabeth's Pensioners, who were splendidly dressed,
and are frequently noticed in the literature of the day. With
Mrs. Quickly they were the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of grandeur&mdash;"And
yet there has been earls, nay, which is more, pensioners"
("Merry Wives," act ii, sc. 2). Milton, too, sings in its
praise&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"With Cowslips wan that hang the pensive head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And every flower that sad embroidery wears."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This association of sadness with the Cowslip is copied by
Mrs. Hemans, who speaks of "Pale Cowslips, meet for
maiden's early bier;" but these are exceptions. All the
other poets who have written of the Cowslip (and they are
very numerous) tell of its joyousness, and brightness, and
tender beauty, and its "bland, yet luscious, meadow-breathing
scent."</p>

<p>The names of the plant are a puzzle; botanically it is a
Primrose, but it is never so called. It has many names, but
its most common are Paigle and Cowslip. Paigle has never
been satisfactorily explained, nor has Cowslip. Our great
etymologists, Cockayne and Dr. Prior and Wedgwood, are
all at variance on the name; and Dr. Prior assures us that it
has nothing to do with either "cows" or "lips," though
the derivation, if untrue, is at least as old as Ben Jonson,
who speaks of "Bright Dayes-eyes and the lips of Cowes."
But we all believe it has, and, without inquiring too closely
into the etymology, we connect the flower with the rich
pastures and meadows of which it forms so pretty a spring
ornament, while its fine scent recalls the sweet breath of the
cow&mdash;"just such a sweet, healthy odour is what we find in
cows; an odour which breathes around them as they sit at
rest on the pasture, and is believed by many, perhaps with
truth, to be actually curative of disease" (Forbes Watson).</p>

<p>Botanically, the Cowslip is a very interesting plant. In all
essential points the Primrose, Cowslip, and Oxlip are identical;
the Primrose, however, choosing woods and copses
and the shelter of the hedgerows, the Cowslip choosing the
open meadows, while the Oxlip is found in either. The
garden "Polyanthus of unnumbered dyes" (Thomson's
"Seasons:" Spring) is only another form produced by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[<a href="./images/67.png">67</a>]</span>cultivation, and is one of the most favourite plants in cottage
gardens. It may, however, well be grown in gardens of
more pretension; it is neat in growth, handsome in flower,
of endless variety, and easy cultivation. There are also
many varieties of the Cowslip, of different colours, double
and single, which are very useful in the spring garden.</p>

<p>The Crow-flower is now the Buttercup,<a name="FNanchor_67:1_65" id="FNanchor_67:1_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_67:1_65" class="fnanchor">[67:1]</a> but in Shakespeare's
time it was applied to the Ragged Robin (<i>Lychnis
flos-cuculi</i>), and I should think that this was the flower that
poor Ophelia wove into her garland. Gerard says, "They
are not used either in medicine or in nourishment; but they
serve for garlands and crowns, and to deck up gardens."
We do not now use the Ragged Robin for the decking of
our gardens, not that we despise it, for it is a flower that all
admire in the hedgerows, but because we have other
members of the same family as easy to grow and more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[<a href="./images/68.png">68</a>]</span>handsome, such as the double variety of the wild plant,
L. Chalcedonica, L. Lagasc&aelig;, L. fulgens, L. Haagena, &amp;c.
In Shakespeare's time the name was also given to the Wild
Hyacinth, which is so named by Turner and Lyte; but this

<p>The Crown Imperial is a Fritillary (<i>F. imperialis</i>). It is
a native of Persia, Afghanistan, and Cashmere, but it was
very early introduced into England from Constantinople,
and at once became a favourite. Chapman, in 1595, spoke
of it as&mdash;</p>

<p>Gerard had it plentifully in his garden, and Parkinson
gave it the foremost place in his "Paradisus Terrestris."
"The Crown Imperial," he says, "for its stately beautifulnesse
deserveth the first place in this our garden of delight,
to be here entreated of before all other Lillies." George
Herbert evidently admired it much&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Peace</i> (13).</p>

<p>And if not in Shakespeare's time, yet certainly very soon
after, there were as many varieties as there are now. The
plant, as a florist's flower, has stood still in a very remarkable
way. Though it is apparently a plant that invites the
attention of the hybridizing gardener, yet we still have but
the two colours, the red and the yellow (a pure white would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[<a href="./images/69.png">69</a>]</span>be a great acquisition), with single and double flowers,
flowers in tiers, and with variegated leaves. And all these
varieties have existed for more than two hundred years.</p>

<p>As a stately garden plant it should be in every garden.
It flowers early, and then dies down. But it should be
planted rather in the background, as the whole plant has an
evil smell, especially in sunshine. Yet it should have a
close attention, if only to study and admire the beautiful
interior of the flower. I know of no other flower that is
similarly formed, and it cannot be better described than in
Gerard's words: "In the bottome of each of the bells
there is placed six drops of most cleere shining sweet water,
in taste like sugar, resembling in shew faire Orient pearles,
the which drops if you take away, there do immediately
appeare the like; notwithstanding, if they may be suffered
to stand still in the floure according to his owne nature,
they wil never fall away, no, not if you strike the plant
untill it be broken." How these drops are formed, and
what service they perform in the economy of the flower,
has not been explained, as far as I am aware; but there is
a pretty German legend which tells how the flower was
originally white and erect, and grew in its full beauty in the
garden of Gethsemane, where it was often noticed and
admired by our Lord; but in the night of the agony, as our
Lord passed through the garden, all the other flowers bowed
their head in sorrowful adoration, the Crown Imperial alone
remaining with its head unbowed, but not for long&mdash;sorrow
and shame took the place of pride, she bent her proud<a name="FNanchor_69:1_66" id="FNanchor_69:1_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_69:1_66" class="fnanchor">[69:1]</a>
head, and blushes of shame, and tears of sorrow soon followed,
and so she has ever continued, with bent head,
blushing colour, and ever-flowing tears. It is a pretty
legend, and may be found at full length in "Good Words
for the Young," August, 1870.</p>

<p>There is a difficulty in deciding what flower Shakespeare
meant by Cuckoo-buds. We now always give the name to
the Meadow Cress (<i>Cardamine pratensis</i>), but it cannot be
that in either of these passages, because that flower is mentioned
under its other name of Lady-smocks in the previous
line (No. <a href="#Cuckoo_1">1</a>), nor is it "of yellow hue;" nor does it grow
among Corn, as described in No. <a href="#Cuckoo_2">2</a>. Many plants have been
suggested, and the choice seems to me to lie between two.
Mr. Swinfen Jervis<a name="FNanchor_70:1_67" id="FNanchor_70:1_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_70:1_67" class="fnanchor">[70:1]</a> decides without hesitation in favour of
Cowslips, and the yellow hue painting the meadows in spring
time gives much force to the decision; Schmidt gives the
same interpretation; but I think the Buttercup, as suggested
by Dr. Prior, will still better meet the requirements.</p>

<p>The Currants of (<a href="#Currant_1">1</a>) are the Currants of commerce, the
fruit of the Vitis Corinthiaca, whence the fruit has derived
its name of Corans, or Currants.</p>

<p>The English Currants are of an entirely different family;
and are closely allied to the Gooseberry. The Currants&mdash;black,
white, and red&mdash;are natives of the northern parts
of Europe, and are probably wild in Britain. They do
not seem to have been much grown as garden fruit till the
early part of the sixteenth century, and are not mentioned by
the earlier writers; but that they were known in Shakespeare's
time we have the authority of Gerard, who, speaking
of Gooseberries, says: "We have also in our London
gardens another sort altogether without prickes, whose fruit
is very small, lesser by muche than the common kinde, but
of a perfect red colour." This "perfect red colour" explains
the "currant lip" of No. <a href="#Currant_2">2</a>.</p>

<p>The Cypress (<i>Cupressus sempervirens</i>), originally a native
of Mount Taurus, is found abundantly through all the South
of Europe, and is said to derive its name from the Island of
Cyprus. It was introduced into England many years before
Shakespeare's time, but is always associated in the old authors
with funerals and churchyards; so that Spenser calls it the
"Cypress funereal," which epithet he may have taken from
Pliny's description of the Cypress: "Natu morosa, fructu
supervacua, baccis torva, foliis amara, odore violenta, ac ne
umbr&acirc; quidem gratiosa&mdash;Diti sacra, et ideo funebri signo ad
domos posita" ("Nat. Hist.," xvi. 32).</p>

<p>Sir John Mandeville mentions the Cypress in a very
curious way: "The Cristene men, that dwellen beyond the
See, in Grece, seyn that the tree of the Cros, that we callen
Cypresse, was of that tree that Adam ete the Appule of; and
that fynde thei writen" ("Voiage," &amp;c., cap. 2). And the old
poem of the "Squyr of lowe degre," gives the tree a sacred
pre-eminence&mdash;</p>

plants.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The author mentions his garden 'by Stebenhythe
by syde London,' and relates that he brought a bough
of Cypress with its Apples from Bristol 'into Estbritzlond,'
fresh in September, to show that it might be propagated by
slips."&mdash;<i>Promptorium Parvulorum</i>, app. 67.</p>

<p>The Cypress is an ornamental evergreen, but stiff in its
growth till it becomes of a good age; and for garden purposes
the European plant is becoming replaced by the richer
forms from Asia and North America, such as C. Lawsoniana,
macrocarpa, Lambertiana, and others.</p>

<p>Of all English plants there have been none in such constant
favour as the Daffodil, whether known by its classical
name of Narcissus, or by its more popular names of Daffodil,
or Daffadowndilly, and Jonquil. The name of Narcissus it
gets from being supposed to be the same as the plant so
named by the Greeks first and the Romans afterwards. It
is a question whether the plants are the same, and I believe
most authors think they are not; but I have never been
able to see very good reasons for their doubts. The name
Jonquil comes corrupted through the French, from <i>juncifolius</i>
or "rush-leaf," and is properly restricted to those
species of the family which have rushy leaves. "Daffodil"
is commonly said to be a corruption of Asphodel ("Daffodil
is <ins class="greek" title="Asphodelon">&#913;&#963;&#966;&#959;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#957;</ins>, and has capped itself with a letter which
eight hundred years ago did not belong to it."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cockayne</span>,
<i>Spoon and Sparrow</i>, 19), with which plant it was confused
(as it is in Lyte's "Herbal"), but Lady Wilkinson says very
positively that "it is simply the old English word 'affodyle,'<a name="FNanchor_73:2_70" id="FNanchor_73:2_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_73:2_70" class="fnanchor">[73:2]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[<a href="./images/74.png">74</a>]</span>which signifies 'that which cometh early.'" "Daffadowndilly,"
again is supposed to be but a playful corruption of
"Daffodil," but Dr. Prior argues (and he is a very safe
authority) that it is rather a corruption of "Saffron Lily."
Daffadowndilly is not used by Shakespeare, but it is used by
his contemporaries, as by Spenser frequently, and by H.
Constable, who died in 1604&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>But however it derived its pretty names, it was the
favourite flower of our ancestors as a garden flower, and
especially as the flower for making garlands, a custom very
much more common then than it is now. It was the
favourite of all English poets. Gower describes the Narcissus&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">"For in the winter fresh and faire<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Confes. Aman.</i> lib. prim. (1. 121 Paulli).</p>

<p>Shakespeare must have had a special affection for it, for in
all his descriptions there is none prettier or more suggestive
than Perdita's short but charming description of the Daffodil
(No. <a href="#Daffodil_2">2</a>). A small volume might be filled with the many
poetical descriptions of this "delectable and sweet-smelling
flower," but there are some which are almost classical, and
which can never be omitted, and which will bear repetition,
however well we know them. Milton says, "The Daffodillies
fill their cups with tears."<a name="FNanchor_74:1_71" id="FNanchor_74:1_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_74:1_71" class="fnanchor">[74:1]</a> There are Herrick's well-known

</div></div>

<p>And there are Keats' and Shelley's well-known and
beautiful lines which bring down the praises of the Daffodil
to our own day. Keats says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A thing of beauty is a joy for ever,<br /></span>

<span class="i0i">For simple sheep; and such are Daffodils<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">With the green world they live in."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Shelley is still warmer in his praise&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Narcissus, the fairest among them all,<br /></span>

<p>Nor must Wordsworth be left out when speaking of the
poetry of Daffodils. His stanzas are well known, while his
sister's prose description of them is the most poetical of all:
"They grew among the mossy stones; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. some rested
their heads on these stones as on a pillow, the rest tossed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[<a href="./images/76.png">76</a>]</span>and reeled and danced, and seemed as if they verily
laughed with the wind, they looked so gay and glancing."<a name="FNanchor_76:1_72" id="FNanchor_76:1_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_76:1_72" class="fnanchor">[76:1]</a></p>

<p>But it is time to come to prose. The Daffodil of Shakespeare
is the Wild Daffodil (<i>Narcissus pseudo-Narcissus</i>)
that is found in abundance in many parts of England. This
is the true English Daffodil, and there is only one other
species that is truly native&mdash;the N. biflorus, chiefly found in
Devonshire. But long before Shakespeare's time a vast
number had been introduced from different parts of Europe,
so that Gerard was able to describe twenty-four different
species, and had "them all and every of them in our
London gardens in great abundance." The family, as at
present arranged by Mr. J. G. Baker, of the Kew Herbarium,
consists of twenty-one species, with several sub-species
and varieties; all of which should be grown. They
are all, with the exception of the Algerian species, which
almost defy cultivation in England, most easy of cultivation&mdash;"Magn&acirc;
cur&acirc; non indigent Narcissi." They only require
after the first planting to be let alone, and then they will
give us their graceful flowers in varied beauty from February
to May. The first will usually be the grand N. maximus,
which may be called the King of Daffodils, though some
authors have given to it a still more illustrious name. The
"Rose of Sharon" was the large yellow Narcissus, common
in Palestine and the East generally, of which Mahomet
said: "He that has two cakes of bread, let him sell one of
them for some flower of the Narcissus, for bread is the food
of the body, but Narcissus is the food of the soul." From
these grand leaders of the tribe we shall be led through the
Hoop-petticoats, the many-flowered Tazettas, and the sweet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>[<a href="./images/77.png">77</a>]</span>Jonquils, till we end the Narcissus season with the Poets'
Narcissus (Ben Jonson's "chequ'd and purple-ringed Daffodilly"),
certainly one of the most graceful flowers that
grows, and of a peculiar fragrance that no other flower has;
so beautiful is it, that even Dr. Forbes Watson's description
of it is scarcely too glowing: "In its general expression
the Poets' Narcissus seems a type of maiden purity and
beauty, yet warmed by a love-breathing fragrance; and yet
what innocence in the large soft eye, which few can rival
amongst the whole tribe of flowers. The narrow, yet vivid
fringe of red, so clearly seen amidst the whiteness, suggests
again the idea of purity, gushing passion&mdash;purity with a
heart which can kindle into fire."</p>

<p>Virgil, in his Fifth Eclogue, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0i">Infelix lolium et steriles dominantur aven&aelig;."<br /></span>

<span class="i1i">Wild Oates, and choaking seedes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And the same is repeated in the first Georgic, and in both
places <i>lolium</i> is always translated Darnel, and so by common
consent Darnel is identified with the Lolium temulentum or
wild Rye Grass. But in Shakespeare's time Darnel, like
<a href="#Cockle">Cockle</a> (which see), was the general name for any hurtful
weed. In the old translation of the Bible, the Zizania,
which is now translated Tares, was sometime translated
Cockle,<a name="FNanchor_78:1_73" id="FNanchor_78:1_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_78:1_73" class="fnanchor">[78:1]</a> and Newton, writing in Shakespeare's time, says&mdash;"Under
the name of Cockle and Darnel is comprehended
all vicious, noisom and unprofitable graine, encombring and
hindring good corne."&mdash;<i>Herball to the Bible.</i> The Darnel
is not only injurious from choking the corn, but its seeds
become mixed with the true Wheat, and so in Dorsetshire&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[<a href="./images/79.png">79</a>]</span>perhaps in other parts&mdash;it has the name of "Cheat"
(Barnes' Glossary), from its false likeness to Wheat. It
was this false likeness that got for it its bad character.
"Darnell or Juray," says Lyte ("Herball," 1578), "is a vitious
graine that combereth or anoyeth corne, especially Wheat,
and in his knotten straw, blades, or leaves is like unto
Wheate." Yet Lindley says that "the noxious qualities of
Darnel or Lolium temulentum seem to rest upon no certain
proof" ("Vegetable Kingdom," p. 116).</p>

<p>The Date is the well-known fruit of the Date Palm
(<i>Ph&oelig;nix dactylifera</i>), the most northern of the Palms. The
Date Palm grows over the whole of Southern Europe, North
Africa, and South-eastern Asia; but it is not probable that
Shakespeare ever saw the tree, though Neckam speaks of it
in the twelfth century, and Lyte describes it, and Gerard
made many efforts to grow it; he tried to grow plants from
the seed, "the which I have planted many times in my
garden, and have grown to the height of three foot, but the
first frost hath nipped them in such sort that they perished,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[<a href="./images/80.png">80</a>]</span>notwithstanding mine industrie by covering them, or what
else I could do for their succour." The fruit, however, was
imported into England in very early times, and was called
by the Anglo-Saxons Finger-Apples, a curious name, but
easily explained as the translation of the Greek name for the
fruit, <ins class="greek" title="daktyloi">&#948;&#945;&#954;&#964;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#953;</ins> which was also the origin of the word date, of

<p>The Dewberry (<i>Rubus c&aelig;sius</i>) is a handsome fruit, very
like the Blackberry, but coming earlier. It has a peculiar
sub-acid flavour, which is much admired by some, as it
must have been by Titania, who joins it with such fruits as
Apricots, Grapes, Figs, and Mulberries. It may be readily
distinguished from the Blackberry by the fruit being composed
of a few larger drupes, and being covered with a
glaucous bloom.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[<a href="./images/82.png">82</a>]</span>to the Cornus, and says: "We for the most part call it the
<i>Dogge berry tree</i>, because the berries are not fit to be eaten,
or to be given to a dogge." The plant is only named by
Shakespeare as a man's name, but it could scarcely be
omitted, as I agree with Mr. Milner that it was "probable
that our dramatist had the tree in his mind when he gave a
name to that fine fellow for a 'sixth and lastly,' Constable,
Dogberry of the Watch" ("Country Pleasures," p. 229).</p>

<p>If Shakespeare had only written these two passages they
would sufficiently have told of his love for simple flowers.
None but a dear lover of such flowers could have written
these lines. There can be no doubt that the Eglantine in
his time was the Sweet Brier&mdash;his notice of the sweet leaf
makes this certain. Gerard so calls it, but makes some
confusion&mdash;which it is not easy to explain&mdash;by saying that
the flowers are white, whereas the flowers of the true Sweet
Brier are pink. In the earlier poets the name seems to
have been given to any wild Rose, and Milton certainly
did not consider the Eglantine and the Sweet Brier to be
identical. He says ("L'Allegro")&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Through the Sweet Briar or the Vine,<br /></span>
<span class="i1i">Or the twisted Eglantine."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Milton's knowledge of flowers was very limited. Herrick
has some pretty lines on the flower, in which it seems most
probable that he was referring to the Sweet Brier&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"From this bleeding hand of mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Take this sprig of Eglantine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Which, though sweet unto your smell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Yet the fretful Briar will tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">He who plucks the sweets shall prove<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Many Thorns to be in love."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was thus the emblem of pleasure mixed with pain&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sweet is the Eglantine, but pricketh nere."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><span class="smcap">Spenser</span>, <i>Sonnet</i> xxvi.</p>

<p>And so its names pronounced it to be; it was either the
Sweet Brier, or it was Eglantine, the thorny plant (Fr.,
<i>aiglentier</i>). There was also an older name for the plant, of
which I can give no explanation. It was called Bedagar.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[<a href="./images/84.png">84</a>]</span>"Bedagar dicitur gallice aiglentier" (John de Gerlande).
"<i>Bedagrage</i>, spina alba, wit-thorn" (Harl. MS., No. 978 in
"Reliqui&aelig; Antiqu&aelig;," i, 36).<a name="FNanchor_84:1_75" id="FNanchor_84:1_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_84:1_75" class="fnanchor">[84:1]</a> The name still exists, though
not in common use; but only as the name of a drug made
from "the excrescences on the branches of the Rose, and
particularly on those of the wild varieties" (Parsons on the
Rose).</p>

<p>It is a native of Britain, but not very common, being
chiefly confined to the South of England. I have found it
on Maidenhead Thicket. As a garden plant it is desirable
for the extremely delicate scent of its leaves, but the flower
is not equal to others of the family. There is, however, a
double-flowered variety, which is handsome. The fruit of
the single flowered tree is large, and of a deep red colour,
and is said to be sometimes made into a preserve. In
modern times this is seldom done, but it may have been
common in Shakespeare's time, for Gerard says quaintly:
"The fruit when it is ripe maketh most pleasant meats and
banqueting dishes, as tarts and such like, the making whereof
I commit to the cunning cooke, and teeth to eat them in
the rich man's mouth." And Drayton says&mdash;</p>

<p>Eglantine has a further interest in being one of the many
thorny trees from which the sacred crown of thorns was
supposed to be made&mdash;"And afterwards he was led into a
garden of Cayphas, and there he was crowned with Eglantine"
(Sir John Mandeville).</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, no tree round which so much of contradictory
folk-lore has gathered as the Elder tree.<a name="FNanchor_85:1_76" id="FNanchor_85:1_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_85:1_76" class="fnanchor">[85:1]</a> With
many it was simply "the stinking Elder," of which nothing
but evil could be spoken. Biron (No. <a href="#Elder_5">5</a>) only spoke the
common medi&aelig;val notion that "Judas was hanged on an
Elder;" and so firm was this belief that Sir John Mandeville
was shown the identical tree at Jerusalem, "and faste
by is zit, the Tree of Eldre that Judas henge himself upon,
for despeyr that he hadde, when he solde and betrayed oure
Lord." This was enough to give the tree a bad fame, which
other things helped to confirm&mdash;the evil smell of its leaves,
the heavy narcotic smell of its flowers, its hard and heartless
wood,<a name="FNanchor_85:2_77" id="FNanchor_85:2_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_85:2_77" class="fnanchor">[85:2]</a> and the ugly drooping black fungus that is almost
exclusively found on it (though it occurs also on the Elm),
which was vulgarly called the Ear of Judas (<i>Hirneola auricula
Jud&aelig;</i>). This was the bad character; but, on the other
hand, there were many who could tell of its many virtues,
so that in 1644 appeared a book entirely devoted to its
praises. This was "The Anatomie of the Elder, translated
from the Latin of Dr. Martin Blockwich by C. de Iryngio"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>[<a href="./images/86.png">86</a>]</span>(<i>i.e.</i>, Christ. Irvine), a book that, in its Latin and English
form, went through several editions. And this favourable
estimate of the tree is still very common in several parts of
the Continent. In the South of Germany it is believed to
drive away evil spirits, and the name "'Holderstock'
(Elder Stock) is a term of endearment given by a lover to
his beloved, and is connected with Hulda, the old goddess
of love, to whom the Elder tree was considered sacred." In
Denmark and Norway it is held in like esteem, and in the
Tyrol an "Elder bush, trained into the form of a cross, is
planted on the new-made grave, and if it blossoms the soul
of the person lying beneath it is happy." And this use of
the Elder for funeral purposes was, perhaps, also an old
English custom; for Spenser, speaking of Death, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Muses that were wont greene Baies to weare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now bringen bittre Eldre braunches seare."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Shepherd's Calendar&mdash;November.</i></p>

<p>Nor must we pass by the high value that was placed on the
wood both by the Jews and Greeks. It was the wood chiefly
used for musical instruments, so that the name Sambuke was
applied to several very different instruments, from the fact
that they were all made of Elder wood. The "sackbut,"
"dulcimer," and "pipe" of Daniel iii. are all connected
together in this manner.</p>

<p>As a garden plant the common Elder is not admissible,
though it forms a striking ornament in the wild hedgerows
and copses, while its flowers yield the highly perfumed Elder-flower
water, and its fruits give the Elder wine; but the tree
runs into many varieties, several of which are very ornamental,
the leaves being often very finely divided and jagged,
and variegated both with golden and silver blotches. There
is a handsome species from Canada (Sambucus Canadensis),
which is worth growing in shrubberies, as it produces its
pure white flowers in autumn.</p>

sixteenth century than now, yet I can nowhere find that the
Vines were ever trained, in the Italian fashion, to Elms or
Poplars. Yet Shakespeare does not stand alone in thus

<p>Gerard tells us that Eringoes are the candied roots of the
Sea Holly (<i>Eryngium maritimum</i>), and he gives the recipe
for candying them. I am not aware that the Sea Holly is
ever now so used, but it is a very handsome plant as it is
seen growing on the sea shore, and its fine foliage makes it
an ornamental plant for a garden. But as used by Falstaff I
am inclined to think that the vegetable he wished for was
the Globe Artichoke, which is a near ally of the Eryngium,
was a favourite diet in Shakespeare's time, and was reputed
to have certain special virtues which are not attributed to
the Sea Holly, but which would more accord with Falstaff's
character.<a name="FNanchor_88:1_79" id="FNanchor_88:1_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_88:1_79" class="fnanchor">[88:1]</a> I cannot, however, anywhere find that the

<p>"Yet the virtues of Fennel, as thus enumerated by Longfellow,
do not comprise either of those attributes of the
plant which illustrate the two passages from Shakespeare.
The first alludes to it as an emblem of flattery, for which
ample authority has been found by the commentators.<a name="FNanchor_89:2_81" id="FNanchor_89:2_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_89:2_81" class="fnanchor">[89:2]</a>
Florio is quoted for the phrase 'Dare finocchio,' <i>to give
fennel</i>, as meaning <i>to flatter</i>. In the second quotation the
allusion is to the reputation of Fennel as an inflammatory
herb with much the same virtues as are attributed to Eringoes."&mdash;Mr.
<span class="smcap">J. F. Marsh</span> in <i>The Garden</i>.</p>

<p>The English name was directly derived from its Latin
name <i>F&oelig;niculum</i>, which may have been given it from its
hay-like smell (<i>f&oelig;num</i>), but this is not certain. We have
another English word derived from the Giant Fennel of the
South of Europe (<i>ferula</i>); this is the ferule, an instrument of
punishment for small boys, also adopted from the Latin, the

same purpose as the modern schoolmaster uses the cane.</p>

<p>The early poets looked on the Fennel as an emblem of
the early summer&mdash;</p>

<p>As a useful plant, the chief use is as a garnishing and sauce
for fish. Large quantities of the seed are said to be imported
to flavour gin, but this can scarcely be called useful. As
ornamental plants, the large Fennels (F. Tingitana, F. campestris,
F. glauca, &amp;c.) are very desirable where they can
have the necessary room.</p>

<p>There is a fashion in plants as in most other things, and
in none is this more curiously shown than in the estimation
in which Ferns are and have been held. Now-a-days it is
the fashion to admire Ferns, and few would be found bold
enough to profess an indifference to them. But it was not
always so. Theocritus seems to have admired the Fern&mdash;</p>

<p>But Virgil gives it a bad character, speaking of it as "filicem
invisam." Horace is still more severe, "neglectis urenda filix
innascitur agris." The Anglo-Saxon translation of Boethius
spoke contemptuously of the "Thorns, and the Furzes, and
the Fern, and all the weeds" (Cockayne). And so it was in
Shakespeare's time. Butler spoke of it as the&mdash;</p>

<p>And later still Gilpin, who wrote so much on the beauties of
country scenery at the close of the last century, has nothing
better to say for Ferns than that they are noxious weeds, to be
classed with "Thorns and Briers, and other ditch trumpery."
The fact, no doubt, is that Ferns were considered something
"uncanny and eerie;" our ancestors could not understand
a plant which seemed to them to have neither flower nor
seed, and so they boldly asserted it had neither. "This
kinde of Ferne," says Lyte in 1587, "beareth neither flowers
nor sede, except we shall take for sede the black spots
growing on the backsides of the leaves, the whiche some do
gather thinking to worke wonders, but to say the trueth it is
nothing els but trumperie and superstition." A plant so
strange must needs have strange qualities, but the peculiar
power attributed to it of making persons invisible arose
thus:&mdash;It was the age in which the doctrine of signatures
was fully believed in; according to which doctrine Nature,
in giving particular shapes to leaves and flowers, had thereby
plainly taught for what diseases they were specially useful.<a name="FNanchor_91:1_82" id="FNanchor_91:1_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_91:1_82" class="fnanchor">[91:1]</a>
Thus a heart-shaped leaf was for heart disease, a liver-shaped
for the liver, a bright-eyed flower was for the eyes, a foot-shaped
flower or leaf would certainly cure the gout, and so
on; and then when they found a plant which certainly grew
and increased, but of which the organs of fructification were
invisible, it was a clear conclusion that properly used the
plant would confer the gift of invisibility. Whether the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[<a href="./images/92.png">92</a>]</span>people really believed this or not we cannot say,<a name="FNanchor_92:1_83" id="FNanchor_92:1_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_92:1_83" class="fnanchor">[92:1]</a> but they
were quite ready to believe any wonder connected with the
plant, and so it was a constant advertisement with the quacks.
Even in Addison's time "it was impossible to walk the streets
without having an advertisement thrust into your hand of a
doctor who had arrived at the knowledge of the Green and
Red Dragon, and had discovered the female Fern-seed.
Nobody ever knew what this meant" ("Tatler," No. 240).
But to name all the superstitions connected with the Fern
would take too much space.</p>

<p>The name is expressive; it is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon
<i>fepern</i>, and so shows that some of our ancestors
marked its feathery form; and its history as a garden plant
is worth a few lines. So little has it been esteemed as a
garden plant that Mr. J. Smith, the ex-Curator of the Kew
Gardens, tells us that in the year 1822 the collection of
Ferns at Kew was so extremely poor that "he could not
estimate the entire Kew collection of exotic Ferns at that
period at more than forty species" (Smith's "Ferns, British
and Exotic," introduction). Since that time the steadily
increasing admiration of Ferns has caused collectors to send
them from all parts of the world, so that in 1866 Mr. Smith
was enabled to describe about a thousand species, and now
the number must be much larger; and the closer search for
Ferns has further brought into notice a very large number
of most curious varieties and monstrosities, which it is still
more curious to observe are, with very few exceptions, confined
to the British species.</p>

<p>In some of these passages (as <a href="#Fig_5">5</a>, <a href="#Fig_6">6</a>, <a href="#Fig_7">7</a>, and perhaps in more)
the reference is to a grossly insulting and indecent gesture
called "making the fig." It was a most unpleasant custom,
which largely prevailed throughout Europe in Shakespeare's
time, and on which I need not dwell. It is fully described
in Douce's "Illustrations of Shakespeare," i, 492.</p>

<p>In some of the other quotations the reference is simply to
the proverbial likeness of a Fig to a matter of the least
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[<a href="./images/94.png">94</a>]</span>importance.<a name="FNanchor_94:1_84" id="FNanchor_94:1_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_94:1_84" class="fnanchor">[94:1]</a> But in the others the dainty fruit, the green
Fig, is noticed.</p>

<p>The Fig tree, celebrated from the earliest times for the
beauty of its foliage and for its "sweetness and good fruit"
(Judges ix. 11), is said to have been introduced into England
by the Romans; but the more reliable accounts attribute its
introduction to Cardinal Pole, who is said to have planted
the Fig tree still living at Lambeth Palace. Botanically,
the Fig is of especial interest. The Fig, as we eat it, is
neither fruit nor flower, though partaking of both, being
really the hollow, fleshy receptacle enclosing a multitude of
flowers, which never see the light, yet come to full perfection
and ripen their seed. The Fig stands alone in this peculiar
arrangement of its flowers, but there are other plants of which
we eat the unopened or undeveloped flowers, as the Artichoke,
the Cauliflower, the Caper, the Clove, and the Pine Apple.</p>

<p>We now commonly call the Iris a Flag, and in Shakespeare's
time the Iris pseudoacorus was called the Water
Flag, and so this passage might, perhaps, have been placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>[<a href="./images/95.png">95</a>]</span>under Flower-de-luce. But I do not think that the Flower-de-luce
proper was ever called a Flag at that time, whereas
we know that many plants, especially the Reeds and Bulrushes,
were called in a general way Flags. This is the case
in the Bible, the language of which is always a safe guide in
the interpretation of contemporary literature. The mother
of Moses having placed the infant in the ark of Bulrushes,
"laid it in the Flags by the river's brink," and the daughter
of Pharaoh "saw the ark among the Flags." Job asks,
"Can the Flag grow without water?" and Isaiah draws the
picture of desolation when "the brooks of defence shall be
emptied and dried up, and the Reeds and the Flags shall
wither." But in these passages, not only is the original
word very loosely translated, but the original word itself was
so loosely used that long ago Jerome had said it might mean
any marsh plant, <i>quidquid in palude virens nascitur</i>. And
in the same way I conclude that when Shakespeare named
the Flag he meant any long-leaved waterside plant that is
swayed to and fro by the stream, and that therefore this
passage might very properly have been placed under Rushes.</p>

<p>The Flax of commerce (<i>Linum usitatissimum</i>) is not a
true native, though Turner said: "I have seen flax or lynt
growyng wilde in Sommerset shyre" ("Herbal," part ii. p. 39);
but it takes kindly to the soil, and soon becomes naturalized
in the neighbourhood of any Flax field or mill. We have,
however, three native Flaxes in England, of which the
smallest, the Fairy Flax (<i>L. catharticum</i>), is one of the
most graceful ornaments of our higher downs and hills.<a name="FNanchor_96:1_86" id="FNanchor_96:1_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_96:1_86" class="fnanchor">[96:1]</a>
The Flax of commerce, which is the plant referred to by
Shakespeare, is supposed to be a native of Egypt, and we
have early notice of it in the Book of Exodus; and the
microscope has shown that the cere-cloths of the most ancient
Egyptian mummies are made of linen. It was very early
introduced into England, and the spinning of Flax was the
regular occupation of the women of every household, from
the mistress downwards, so that even queens are represented
in the old illuminations in the act of spinning, and "the
spinning-wheel was a necessary implement in every household,
from the palace to the cottage."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wright</span>, <i>Domestic
Manners</i>. The occupation is now almost gone, driven out
by machinery, but it has left its mark on our language, at
least on our legal language, which acknowledges as the
only designation of an unmarried woman that she is "a
spinster."</p>

<p>A crop of Flax is one of the most beautiful, from the rich
colour of the flowers resting on their dainty stalks. But it
is also most useful; from it we get linen, linseed oil, oilcake,
and linseed-meal; nor do its virtues end there, for "Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>[<a href="./images/97.png">97</a>]</span>John Herschel tells us the surprising fact that old linen
rags will, when treated with sulphuric acid, yield more than
their own weight of sugar. It is something even to have
lived in days when our worn-out napkins may possibly
reappear on our tables in the form of sugar."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lady
Wilkinson.</span></p>

<p>As garden plants the Flaxes are all ornamental. There
are about eighty species, some herbaceous and some shrubby,
and of almost all colours, and in most of the species the
colours are remarkably bright and clear. There is no finer
blue than in L. usitatissimum, no finer yellow than in L.
trigynum, or finer scarlet than in L. grandiflorum.</p>

<p>Out of these five passages four relate to the Fleur-de-luce
as the cognizance of France, and much learned ink has been
spilled in the endeavour to find out what flower, if any, was
intended to be represented, so that Mr. Planch&eacute; says that
"next to the origin of heraldry itself, perhaps nothing connected
with it has given rise to so much controversy as the
origin of this celebrated charge." It has been at various
times asserted to be an Iris, a Lily, a sword-hilt, a spearhead,
and a toad, or to be simply the Fleur de St. Louis.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>[<a href="./images/98.png">98</a>]</span><i>Adhuc sub judice lis est</i>&mdash;and it is never likely to be satisfactorily
settled. I need not therefore dwell on it, especially
as my present business is to settle not what the Fleur-de-luce
meant in the arms of France, but what it meant in Shakespeare's
writings. But here the same difficulty at once
meets us, some writers affirming stoutly that it is a Lily,
others as stoutly that it is an Iris. For the Lily theory
there are the facts that Shakespeare calls it one of the
Lilies, and that the other way of spelling it is Fleur-de-lys.
I find also a strong confirmation of this in the writings of
St. Francis de Sales (contemporary with Shakespeare).
"Charity," he says, "comprehends the seven gifts of the
Holy Ghost, and resembles a beautiful Flower-de-luce, which
has six leaves whiter than snow, and in the middle the
pretty little golden hammers" ("Philo," book xi., Mulholland's
translation). This description will in no way fit
the Iris, but it may very well be applied to the White Lily.
Chaucer, too, seems to connect the Fleur-de-luce with the
Lily&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Her nekke was white as the Flour de Lis."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These are certainly strong authorities for saying that the
Flower-de-luce is the Lily. But there are as strong or
stronger on the other side. Spenser separates the Lilies
from the Flower-de-luces in his pretty lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Strow mee the grounde with Daffadown-Dillies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And Cowslips, and Kingcups, and lov&eacute;d Lillies;<br /></span>
<span class="i5i">The Pretty Pawnce<br /></span>
<span class="i5i">And the Chevisaunce<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Shall match with the fayre Floure Delice."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Shepherd's Calendar.</i></p>

<p>Ben Jonson separates them in the same way&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bring rich Carnations, Flower-de-luces, Lillies."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Lord Bacon also separates them: "In April follow the
double White Violet, the Wall-flower, the Stock-Gilliflower,
the Cowslip, the Flower-de-luces, and Lilies of all Natures;"
and so does Drayton&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Lily and the Flower de Lis<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">For colours much contenting."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Nymphal V.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>[<a href="./images/99.png">99</a>]</span>
In heraldry also the Fleur-de-lis and the Lily are two distinct
bearings. Then, from the time of Turner in 1568,
through Gerard and Parkinson to Miller, all the botanical
writers identify the Iris as the plant named, and with this
judgment most of our modern writers agree.<a name="FNanchor_99:1_87" id="FNanchor_99:1_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_99:1_87" class="fnanchor">[99:1]</a> We may,
therefore, assume that Shakespeare meant the Iris as the
flower given by Perdita, and we need not be surprised at his
classing it among the Lilies. Botanical classification was
not very accurate in his day, and long after his time two
such celebrated men as Redout&eacute; and De Candolle did not
hesitate to include in the "Liliac&aelig;," not only Irises, but
Daffodils, Tulips, Fritillaries, and even Orchids.</p>

<p>What Iris Shakespeare especially alluded to it is useless to
inquire. We have two in England that are indigenous&mdash;one
the rich golden-yellow (<i>I. pseudacorus</i>), which in some
favourable positions, with its roots in the water of a brook,
is one of the very handsomest of the tribe; the other the
Gladwyn (<i>I. f&oelig;tidissima</i>), with dull flowers and strong-smelling
leaves, but with most handsome scarlet fruit, which
remain on the plant and show themselves boldly all through
the winter and early spring. Of other sorts there is a large
number, so that the whole family, according to the latest
account by Mr. Baker, of Kew, contains ninety-six distinct
species besides varieties. They come from all parts of the
world, from the Arctic Circle to the South of China; they
are of all colours, from the pure white Iris Florentina to the
almost black I. Susiana; and of all sizes, from a few inches
to four feet or more. They are mostly easy of cultivation
and increase readily, so that there are few plants better
suited for the hardy garden or more ornamental.</p>

<p>Of Fumitories we have five species in England, all of
them weeds in cultivated grounds and in hedgerows. None
of them can be considered garden plants, but they are closely
allied to the Corydalis, of which there are several pretty
species, and to the very handsome Dielytras, of which one
species&mdash;D. spectabilis&mdash;ranks among the very handsomest
of our hardy herbaceous plants. How the plant acquired its
name of Fumitory&mdash;<i>fume-terre</i>, earth-smoke&mdash;is not very
satisfactorily explained, though many explanations have been
given; but that the name was an ancient one we know from
the interesting Stockholm manuscript of the eleventh century
published by Mr. J. Pettigrew, and of which a few lines are
worth quoting. (The poem is published in the "Arch&aelig;ologia,"
vol. xxx.)&mdash;</p>

Whin; but in the sixteenth century I think that the Furze
and Gorse were distinguished (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#Gorse">Gorse</a></span>), and that the
brown Furze was the Ulex. It is a most beautiful plant, and
with its golden blossoms and richly scented flowers is the
glory of our wilder hill-sides. It is especially a British plant,
for though it is found in other parts of Europe, and even in
the Azores and Canaries, yet I believe it is nowhere found
in such abundance or in such beauty as in England. Gerard
says, "The greatest and highest that I did ever see do grow
about Excester, in the West Parts of England;" and those
that have seen it in Devonshire will agree with him. It
seems to luxuriate in the damp, mild climate of Devonshire,
and to see it in full flower as it covers the low hills that abut
upon the Channel between Ilfracombe and Clovelly is a sight
to be long remembered. It is, indeed, a plant that we may
well be proud of. Linn&aelig;us could only grow it in a greenhouse,
and there is a well-known story of Dillenius that
when he first saw the Furze in blossom in England he fell
on his knees and thanked God for sparing his life to see so
beautiful a part of His creation. The story may be apocryphal,
but we have a later testimony from another celebrated
traveller who had seen the glories of tropical scenery, and
yet was faithful to the beauties of the wild scenery of England.
Mr. Wallace bears this testimony: "I have never
seen in the tropics such brilliant masses of colour as even
England can show in her Furze-clad commons, her glades
of Wild Hyacinths, her fields of Poppies, her meadows of
Buttercups and Orchises, carpets of yellow, purple, azure
blue, and fiery crimson, which the tropics can rarely exhibit.
We have smaller masses of colour in our Hawthorns and
Crab trees, our Holly and Mountain Ash, our Broom, Foxgloves,
Primroses, and purple Vetches, which clothe with
gay colours the length and breadth of our land" ("Malayan
Archipelago," ii. 296).</p>

<p>As a garden shrub the Furze may be grown either as
a single lawn shrub or in the hedge or shrubbery. Everywhere
it will be handsome both in its single and double
varieties, and as it bears the knife well, it can be kept
within limits. The upright Irish form also makes an elegant
shrub, but does not flower so freely as the typical plant.</p>

<p>There is something almost mysterious in the Garlick that
it should be so thoroughly acceptable, almost indispensable,
to many thousands, while to others it is so horribly offensive
as to be unbearable. The Garlick of Egypt was one
of the delicacies that the Israelites looked back to with fond
regret, and we know from Herodotus that it was the daily
food of the Egyptian labourer; yet, in later times, the
Mohammedan legend recorded that "when Satan stepped
out from the Garden of Eden after the fall of man, Garlick
sprung up from the spot where he placed his left foot,
and Onions from that which his right foot touched, on
which account, perhaps, Mohammed habitually fainted at
the sight of either." It was the common food also of the
Roman labourer, but Horace could only wonder at the
"dura messorum illia" that could digest the plant "cicutis
allium nocentius." It was, and is the same with its medical
virtues. According to some it was possessed of every
virtue,<a name="FNanchor_102:1_88" id="FNanchor_102:1_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_102:1_88" class="fnanchor">[102:1]</a> so that it had the name of Poor Man's Treacle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>[<a href="./images/103.png">103</a>]</span>(the word treacle not having its present meaning, but
being the Anglicised form of theriake, or heal-all<a name="FNanchor_103:1_89" id="FNanchor_103:1_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_103:1_89" class="fnanchor">[103:1]</a>); while,
on the other hand, Gerard affirmed "it yieldeth to the
body no nourishment at all; it ingendreth naughty and
sharpe bloud."</p>

<p>Bullein describes it quaintly: "It is a grosse kinde of
medicine, verye unpleasant for fayre Ladies and tender Lilly
Rose colloured damsels which often time profereth sweet
breathes before gentle wordes, but both would do very
well" ("Book of Simples"). Yet if we could only divest it
of its evil smell, the wild Wood Garlick would rank among
the most beautiful of our British plants. Its wide leaves are
very similar to those of the Lily of the Valley, and its starry
flowers are of the very purest white. But it defies picking,
and where it grows it generally takes full possession, so that
I have known several woods&mdash;especially on the Cotswold
Hills&mdash;that are to be avoided when the plant is in flower.
The woods are closely carpeted with them, and every step
you take brings out their f&oelig;tid odour. There are many
species grown in the gardens, some of which are even very
sweet smelling (as A. odorum and A. fragrans); but these
are the exceptions, and even these have the Garlick scent
in their leaves and roots. Of the rest many are very
pretty and worth growing, but they are all more or less
tainted with the evil habits of the family.</p>

<p>Ginger was well known both to the Greeks and Romans.
It was imported from Arabia, together with its name, Zingiberri,
which it has retained, with little variation, in all
languages.</p>

<p>When it was first imported into England is not known,
but probably by the Romans, for it occurs as a common
ingredient in many of the Anglo-Saxon medical recipes.
Russell, in the "Boke of Nurture," mentions several kinds
of Ginger; as green and white, "colombyne, valadyne, and
Maydelyn." In Shakespeare's time it was evidently very
common and cheap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>[<a href="./images/105.png">105</a>]</span>
It is produced from the roots of Zingiber officinale, a
member of the large and handsome family of the Ginger-worts.
The family contains some of the most beautiful of
our greenhouse plants, as the Hedychiums, Alpinias, and
Mantisias; and, though entirely tropical, most of the species
are of easy cultivation in England. Ginger is very easily
reared in hotbeds, and I should think it very probable that
it may have been so grown in Shakespeare's time. Gerard
attempted to grow it, but he naturally failed, by trying to
grow it in the open ground as a hardy plant; yet "it
sprouted and budded forth greene leaves in my garden in
the heate of somer;" and he tells us that plants were sent
him by "an honest and expert apothecarie, William Dries,
of Antwerp," and "that the same had budded and grown in
the said Dries' garden."</p>

<p>The Gooseberry is probably a native of the North of
England, but Turner said (s.v. <i>uva crispa</i>) "it groweth
onely that I have sene in England, in gardines, but I have
sene it in Germany abrode in the fieldes amonge other
busshes."</p>

<p>The name has nothing to do with the goose. Dr. Prior
has satisfactorily shown that the word is a corruption of
"Crossberry." By the writers of Shakespeare's time, and
even later, it was called Feaberry (Gerard, Lawson, and
others), and in one of the many books on the Plague published
in the sixteenth century, the patient is recommended to
eat "thepes, or goseberries" ("A Counsell against the
Sweate," fol. 23).</p>

<p>In speaking of the <a href="#Furze">Furze</a> (which see), I said that in
Shakespeare's time the Furze and Gorse were probably
distinguished, though now the two names are applied to
the same plant. "In the 15th Henry VI. (1436), license
was given to Humfrey, Duke of Gloucester, to inclose 200
acres of land&mdash;pasture, wode, hethe, vrises,<a name="FNanchor_106:1_90" id="FNanchor_106:1_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_106:1_90" class="fnanchor">[106:1]</a> and gorste

"Gorst" was different from the "Vrise," and it may very
likely have been the Petty Whin. "Pricking Goss," however,
may be only a generic term, like Bramble and Brier,
for any wild prickly plant.</p>

Grass of the field."</p>

<p>In the whole range of botanical studies the accurate study
of the Grasses is, perhaps, the most difficult as the genus is
the most extensive, for Grasses are said to "constitute, perhaps,
a twelfth part of the described species of flowering
plants, and at least nine-tenths of the number of individuals
comprising the vegetation of the world" (Lindley), so that a
full study of the Grasses may almost be said to be the work
of a lifetime. But Shakespeare was certainly no such student
of Grasses: in all these passages Grass is only mentioned in
a generic manner, without any reference to any particular
Grass. The passages in which hay is mentioned, I have not
thought necessary to quote.</p>

<p>The Harebell of Shakespeare is undoubtedly the Wild
Hyacinth (<i>Scilla nutans</i>), the "sanguine flower inscribed
with woe" of Milton's "Lycidas," though we must bear in
mind that the name is applied differently in various parts of
the island; thus "the Harebell of Scotch writers is the
Campanula, and the Bluebell, so celebrated in Scottish song,
is the Wild Hyacinth or Scilla; while in England the same
names are used conversely, the Campanula being the Bluebell
and the Wild Hyacinth the Harebell" ("Poets' Pleasaunce")&mdash;but
this will only apply in poetry; in ordinary
language, at least in the South of England, the Wild Hyacinth
is the Bluebell, and is the plant referred to by Shakespeare
as the Harebell.</p>

<p>It is one of the chief ornaments of our woods,<a name="FNanchor_109:1_92" id="FNanchor_109:1_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_109:1_92" class="fnanchor">[109:1]</a> growing

flower it may well be introduced into shrubberies, but as a
border plant it cannot compete with its rival relation, the
Hyacinthus orientalis, which is the parent of all the fine
double and many coloured Hyacinths in which the florists
have delighted for the last two centuries.</p>

<p>Under its many names of Albespeine, Whitethorn, Haythorn
or Hawthorn, May, and Quickset, this tree has ever
been a favourite with all lovers of the country.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Among the many buds proclaiming May,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Decking the field in holiday array,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Striving who shall surpass in braverie,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>such is Browne's advice in his "Britannia's Pastorals" (ii.
2). He, like the other early poets, clearly loved the tree
for its beauty; and in picturesque beauty the Hawthorn
yields to none, when it can be seen in some sheltered valley
growing with others of its kind, and allowed to grow unpruned,
for then in the early summer it is literally a sheet
of white, yet beautifully relieved by the tender green of
the young leaves, and by the bright crimson of the anthers,
and loaded with a scent that is most delicate and refreshing.
But not only for its beauty is the Hawthorn a favourite tree,
but also for its many pleasant associations&mdash;it is essentially
the May tree, the tree that tells that winter is really past,
and that summer has fairly begun. Hear Spenser&mdash;</p>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Shepherd's Calendar&mdash;May.</i></p>

<p>Yet in spite of its pretty name, and in spite of the poets,
the Hawthorn now seldom flowers till June, and I should
suppose it is never in flower on May Day, except perhaps in
Devonshire and Cornwall; and it is very doubtful if it ever
were so found, except in these southern counties, though
some fancy that the times of flowering of several of our
flowers are changed, and in some instances largely changed.
But "it was an old custom in Suffolk, in most of the farmhouses,
that any servant who could bring in a branch of
Hawthorn in full blossom on the 1st of May was entitled to
a dish of cream for breakfast. This custom is now disused,
not so much from the reluctance of the masters to give the
reward, as from the inability of the servants to find the
Whitethorn in flower."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Brand's</span> <i>Antiquities</i>.<a name="FNanchor_112:1_93" id="FNanchor_112:1_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_112:1_93" class="fnanchor">[112:1]</a> Even those
who might not see the beauty of an old Thorn tree,
have found its uses as one of the very few trees that will
grow thick in the most exposed places, and so give pleasant
shade and shelter in places where otherwise but little shade
and shelter could be found.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Every shepherd tells his tale<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Under the Hawthorn in the dale."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Milton.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And "at Hesket, in Cumberland, yearly on St. Barnabas'
Day, by the highway side under a Thorn tree is kept the
court for the whole forest of Englewood."&mdash;<i>History of
Westmoreland.</i></p>

<p>The Thorn may well be admitted as a garden shrub either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>[<a href="./images/113.png">113</a>]</span>in its ordinary state, or in its beautiful double white, red, and
pink varieties, and those who like to grow curious trees
should not omit the Glastonbury Thorn, which flowers at
the ordinary time, and bears fruit, but also buds and flowers
again in winter, showing at the same time the new flowers
and the older fruit.</p>

<p>Nor must we omit to mention that the Whitethorn is one
of the trees that claims to have been used for the sacred
Crown of Thorns. It is most improbable that it was so, in
fact almost certain that it was not; but it was a medi&aelig;val
belief, as Sir John Mandeville witnesses: "Then was our
Lord yled into a gardyn, and there the Jewes scorned hym,
and maden hym a crowne of the branches of the Albiespyne,
that is Whitethorn, that grew in the same gardyn, and
setten yt upon hys heved. And therefore hath the Whitethorn
many virtues. For he that beareth a branch on hym
thereof, no thundre, ne no maner of tempest may dere hym,
ne in the howse that it is ynne may non evil ghost enter."</p>

<p>And we may finish the Hawthorn with a short account of
its name, which is interesting:&mdash;"Haw," or "hay," is the
same word as "hedge" ("sepes, id est, <i>haies</i>," John de Garlande),
and so shows the great antiquity of this plant as
used for English hedges. In the north, "haws" are still
called "haigs;" but whether Hawthorn was first applied to
the fruit or the hedge, whether the hedge was so called
because it was made of the Thorn tree that bears the haws,
or whether the fruit was so named because it was borne on
the hedge tree, is a point on which etymologists differ.</p>

<p>Dr. Prior has decided that "'Filbert' is a barbarous
compound of <i>phillon</i> or <i>feuille</i>, a leaf, and <i>beard</i>, to denote
its distinguishing peculiarity, the leafy involucre projecting
beyond the nut." But in the times before Shakespeare the
name was more poetically said to be derived from the nymph
Phyllis. Nux Phyllidos is its name in the old vocabularies,
and Gower ("Confessio Amantis") tells us why&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>[<a href="./images/115.png">115</a>]</span></p>

</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem">(Lib. quart.),</p>

<p>and so Spenser spoke of it as "'Phillis' philbert" (Elegy
17).<a name="FNanchor_115:1_94" id="FNanchor_115:1_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_115:1_94" class="fnanchor">[115:1]</a></p>

<p>The Nut, the Filbert, and the Cobnut, are all botanically
the same, and the two last were cultivated in England long
before Shakespeare's time, not only for the fruit, but also,
and more especially, for the oil.</p>

<p>There is a peculiarity in the growth of the Nut that
is worth the notice of the botanical student. The male
blossoms, or catkins (anciently called "agglettes or blowinges"),
are mostly produced at the ends of the year's
shoots, while the pretty little crimson female blossoms are
produced close to the branch; they are completely sessile
or unstalked. Now in most fruit trees, when a flower is
fertilized, the fruit is produced exactly in the same place,
with respect to the main tree, that the flower occupied; a
Peach or Apricot, for instance, rests upon the branch which
bore the flower. But in the Nut a different arrangement
prevails. As soon as the flower is fertilized it starts away
from the parent branch; a fresh branch is produced, bearing
leaves and the Nut or Nuts at the end, so that the Nut is
produced several inches away from the spot on which the
flower originally was. I know of no other tree that produces
its fruit in this way, nor do I know what special
benefit to the plant arises from this arrangement.</p>

<p>Much folk-lore has gathered round the Hazel tree and
the Nuts. The cracking of Nuts, with much fortune-telling
connected therewith, was the favourite amusement on All
Hallow's Eve (Oct. 31), so that the Eve was called Nutcrack
Night. I believe the custom still exists; it certainly has
not been very long abolished, for the Vicar of Wakefield
and his neighbours "religiously cracked Nuts on All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>[<a href="./images/116.png">116</a>]</span>Hallow's Eve." And in many places "an ancient custom
prevailed of going a Nutting on Holy Rood Day (Sept. 14),
which it was esteemed quite unlucky to omit."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Forster.</span><a name="FNanchor_116:1_95" id="FNanchor_116:1_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_116:1_95" class="fnanchor">[116:1]</a></p>

<p>A greater mystery connected with the Hazel is the divining
rod, for the discovery of water and metals. This has always
by preference been a forked Hazel-rod, though sometimes
other rods are substituted. The belief in its power dates
from a very early period, and is by no means extinct. The
divining-rod is said to be still used in Cornwall, and firmly
believed in; nor has this belief been confined to the uneducated.
Even Linn&aelig;us confessed himself to be half a
convert to it, and learned treatises have been written
accepting the facts, and accounting for them by electricity
or some other subtle natural agency. Most of us, however,
will rather agree with Evelyn's cautious verdict, that the
virtues attributed to the forked stick "made out so solemnly
by the attestation of magistrates, and divers other learned
and credible persons, who have critically examined matters
of fact, is certainly next to a miracle, and requires a strong
faith."</p>

<p>There are other passages in which the word Heath occurs
in Shakespeare, but in none else is the flower referred to;
the other references are to an open heath or common. And
in this place no special Heath can be selected, unless by
"long Heath" we suppose him to have meant the Ling
(<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>). And this is most probable, for so Lyte
calls it. "There is in this countrie two kindes of Heath,
one which beareth the flowres alongst the stemmes, and is
called Long Heath." But it is supposed by some that the
correct reading is "Ling, Heath," &amp;c., and in that case
Heath will be a generic word, meaning any of the British
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>[<a href="./images/117.png">117</a>]</span>
species (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#Ling">Ling</a></span>)]. Of British species there are five, and
wherever they exist they are dearly prized as forming a rich
element of beauty in our landscapes. They are found all
over the British Islands, and they seem to be quite indifferent
as to the place of their growth. They are equally beautiful
in the extreme Highlands of Scotland, or on the Quantock
and Exmoor Hills of the South&mdash;everywhere they clothe the
hill-sides with a rich garment of purple that is wonderfully
beautiful, whether seen under the full influence of the
brightest sunshine, or under the dark shadows of the
blackest thundercloud. And the botanical geography of
the Heath tribe is very remarkable; it is found over the
whole of Europe, in Northern Asia, and in Northern Africa.
Then the tribe takes a curious leap, being found in immense
abundance, both of species and individuals, in Southern
Africa, while it is entirely absent from North and South
America. Not a single species has been found in the New
World. A few plants of Calluna vulgaris have been found
in Newfoundland and Massachusetts, but that is not a true
Heath.</p>

<p>As a garden plant the Heath has been strangely neglected.
Many of the species are completely hardy, and will make
pretty evergreen bushes of from 2ft. to 4ft. high, but they
are better if kept close-grown by constant clipping. The
species best suited for this treatment are E. Mediterranea,
E. arborea, and E. codonoides. Of the more humble-growing
species, E. vagans (the Cornish Heath) will grow
easily in most gardens, though in its native habitat it is confined
to the serpentine formation; nor must we omit E.
herbacea, which also will grow anywhere, and, if clipped
yearly after flowering, will make a most beautiful border to
any flower-bed; or it may be used more extensively, as it is
at Doddington Park, in Gloucestershire (Sir Gerald Codrington's),
where there is a large space in front of the house,
several yards square, entirely filled with E. herbacea. When
this is in flower (and it is so for nearly two months, or sometimes
more) the effect, as seen from above, is of the richest
Turkey carpet, but of such a colour and harmony as no
Turkey carpet ever attained.</p>

<p>Several of the South-European Heaths were cultivated in
England in Shakespeare's time.</p>

It may be taken for granted that all these authors allude
to the same tree, but what tree is meant has sorely puzzled
the commentators. Some naturally suggested the Ebony,
and this view is supported by the respectable names of
Archdeacon Nares, Douce, Schmidt, and Dyce. A larger
number pronounced with little hesitation in favour of
Henbane (<i>Hyoscyamus niger</i>), the poisonous qualities of
which were familiar to the contemporaries of Shakespeare,
and were supposed by most of the botanical writers of his
day (and on the authority of Pliny) to be communicated by
being poured into the ears. But the Henbane is not a tree,
as Gower's "Hebenus" and Spenser's "Heben" certainly
were; and though it will satisfy some of the requirements
of the plant named by Shakespeare, it will not satisfy all.<a name="FNanchor_119:1_97" id="FNanchor_119:1_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_119:1_97" class="fnanchor">[119:1]</a></p>

<p>It might have been supposed that the difficulty would at
once have been cleared up by reference to the accounts of
the death of Hamlet's father, as given by Saxo Grammaticus,
and the old "Hystorie of Hamblet," but neither of these
writers attribute his death to poison.<a name="FNanchor_119:2_98" id="FNanchor_119:2_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_119:2_98" class="fnanchor">[119:2]</a></p>

<p>The question has lately been very much narrowed and
satisfactorily settled (for the present, certainly, and probably
altogether) by Dr. Nicholson and the Rev. W. A. Harrison.
These gentlemen have decided that the true reading is
Hebona, and that Hebona is the Yew. Their views are
stated at full length in two exhaustive papers contributed to
the New Shakespeare Society, and published in their "Transactions."<a name="FNanchor_119:3_99" id="FNanchor_119:3_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_119:3_99" class="fnanchor">[119:3]</a>
The full argument is too long for insertion here,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>[<a href="./images/120.png">120</a>]</span>and my readers will thank me for referring them to the
papers in the "Transactions." The main arguments are based
on three facts: 1. That in nearly all the northern nations
(including, of course, Denmark) the name of the Yew is
more or less like Heben. 2. That all the effects attributed
by Shakespeare to the action of Hebona are described as
arising from Yew-poisoning by different medical writers,
some of them contemporary with him, and some writing
with later experiences. 3. That the <i>post mortem</i> appearances
after Yew-poisoning and after snake-poisoning are
very similar, and it was "given out, that sleeping in my
orchard, a serpent stung me."</p>

<p>But it may well be asked, How could Shakespeare have
known of all these effects, which (as far as our present search
has discovered) are not named by any one writer of his
time, and some of which have only been made public from
the results of Yew-poisoning since his day? I think the
question can be answered in a very simple way. The
effects are described with such marked minuteness that it
seems to me not only very probable, but almost certain,
that Shakespeare must have been an eye-witness of a case of
Yew-poisoning, and that what he saw had been so photographed
on his mind that he took the first opportunity that
presented itself to reproduce the picture. With his usual
grand contempt for perfect accuracy he did not hesitate to
sweep aside at once the strict historical records of the old
king's death, and in its place to paint for us a cold-blooded
murder carried out by means which he knew from his
personal experience to be possible, and which he felt himself
able to describe with a minuteness which his knowledge
of his audiences assured him would not be out of place
even in that great tragedy.</p>

<p>The objection to the Yew theory of Hebona, that the
Yew is named by Shakespeare under its more usual name,
is no real objection. On the same ground Ebony and
Henbane must be excluded; together with Gilliflowers,
which he elsewhere speaks of as Carnations; and Woodbine,
because he also speaks of Honeysuckle.</p>

<p>In all these passages, except the last, the reference is to
rope made from Hemp, and not to the Hemp plant, and it
is very probable that Shakespeare never saw the plant. It
was introduced into England long before his time, and
largely cultivated, but only in few parts of England, and
chiefly in the eastern counties. I do not find that it was
cultivated in gardens in his time, but it is a plant well
deserving a place in any garden, and is especially suitable
from its height and regular growth, for the central plant
of a flower-bed. It is supposed to be a native of India, and
seems capable of cultivation in almost any climate.<a name="FNanchor_122:1_100" id="FNanchor_122:1_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_122:1_100" class="fnanchor">[122:1]</a></p>

From this single notice of the Holly in Shakespeare, and
from the slight account of it in Gerard, we might conclude
that the plant was not the favourite in the sixteenth century
that it is in the nineteenth; but this would be a mistake.
The Holly entered largely into the old Christmas carols.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Christmastide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes in like a bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Holly and Ivy clad"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and it was from the earliest times used for the decoration
of houses and churches at Christmas. It does not,
however, derive its name from this circumstance, though it
was anciently spelt "holy," or called the "holy tree," for
the name comes from a very different source, and is identical
with "holm," which, indeed, was its name in the time
of Gerard and Parkinson, and is still its name in some
parts of England, though it has almost lost its other old
name of Hulver,<a name="FNanchor_123:1_101" id="FNanchor_123:1_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_123:1_101" class="fnanchor">[123:1]</a> except in the eastern counties, where
the word is still in use. But as an ornamental tree it
does not seem to have been much valued, though in the
next century Evelyn is loud in the praises of this "incomparable
tree," and admired it both for its beauty and
its use. It is certainly the handsomest of our native evergreens,
and is said to be finer in England than in any other
country; and as seen growing in its wild habitats in our
forests, as it may be seen in the New Forest and the Forest
of Dean, it stands without a rival, equally beautiful in
summer and in winter; in summer its bright glossy leaves
shining out distinctly in the midst of any surrounding
greenery, while as "the Holly that outdares cold winter's
ire" (Browne), it is the very emblem of bright cheerfulness,
with its foliage uninjured in the most severe weather, and its
rich coral berries, sometimes borne in the greatest profusion,
delighting us with their brilliancy and beauty. And as a
garden shrub, the Holly still holds its own, after all the fine
exotic shrubs that have been introduced into our gardens
during the present century. It can be grown as a single
shrub, or it may be clipped, and will then form the best and
the most impregnable hedge that can be grown. No other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[<a href="./images/124.png">124</a>]</span>plant will compare with it as a hedge plant, if it be only
properly attended to, and we can understand Evelyn's pride
in his "glorious and refreshing object," a Holly hedge 160ft.
in length, 7ft. in height, and 5ft. in diameter, which he
could show in his "poor gardens at any time of the year,
glittering with its armed and vernished leaves," and "blushing
with their natural corale." Nor need we be confined to
plain green in such a hedge. The Holly runs into a great
many varieties, with the leaves of all shapes and sizes, and
blotched and variegated in different fashions and colours.
All of these seem to be comparatively modern. In the
time of Gerard and Parkinson there seems to have been
only the one typical species, and perhaps the Hedgehog
Holly.</p>

<p>I may finish the notice of the Holly by quoting two most
remarkable uses of the tree mentioned by Parkinson:
"With the flowers of Holly, saith Pliny from Pythagoras,
water is made ice; and againe, a staffe of the tree throwne
at any beast, although it fall short by his defect that threw
it, will flye to him, as he lyeth still, by the speciall property
of the tree." He may well add&mdash;"This I here relate that
you may understand the fond and vain conceit of those
times, which I would to God we were not in these dayes
tainted withal."</p>

<p>The <i>Carduus benedictus</i>, or Blessed Thistle, is a handsome
annual from the South of Europe, and obtained its
name from its high reputation as a heal-all, being supposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[<a href="./images/125.png">125</a>]</span>even to cure the plague, which was the highest praise that
could be given to a medicine in those days. It is mentioned
in all the treatises on the Plague, and especially by Thomas
Brasbridge, who, in 1578, published his "Poore Mans
Jewell, that is to say, a Treatise of the Pestilence: vnto
which is annexed a declaration of the vertues of the Hearbes
Carduus Benedictus and Angelica." This little book
Shakespeare may have seen; it speaks of the virtues of the
"distilled" leaves: it says, "it helpeth the hart," "expelleth
all poyson taken in at the mouth and other corruption that
doth hurt and annoye the hart," and that "the juyce of it is
outwardly applied to the bodie" ("lay it to your heart"), and
concludes, "therefore I counsell all them that have Gardens
to nourish it, that they may have it always to their own use,
and the use of their neighbours that lacke it." The plant
has long lost this high character.</p>

I have joined together here the Woodbine and the
Honeysuckle, because there can be little doubt that in
Shakespeare's time the two names belonged to the same
plant,<a name="FNanchor_126:1_102" id="FNanchor_126:1_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_126:1_102" class="fnanchor">[126:1]</a> and that the Woodbine was (where the two names
were at all discriminated, as in No. <a href="#Honeysuckle_3">3</a>), applied to the plant
generally, and Honeysuckle to the flower. This seems
very clear by comparing together Nos. <a href="#Honeysuckle_1">1</a> and <a href="#Honeysuckle_2">2</a>. In earlier
writings the name was applied very loosely to almost any
creeping or climbing plant. In an Anglo-Saxon Vocabulary
of the eleventh century it is applied to the Wild Clematis
("Viticella&mdash;Weoden-binde"); while in Archbishop &AElig;lfric's
"Vocabulary" of the tenth century it is applied to the
Hedera nigra, which may be either the Common or the
Ground Ivy ("Hedera nigra&mdash;Wude-binde"); and in the
Herbarium and Leechdom books of the twelfth century it is
applied to the Capparis or Caper-plant, by which, however
(as Mr. Cockayne considers), the Convolvulus Sepium is
meant. After Shakespeare's time again the words began to
be used confusedly. Milton does not seem to have been
very clear in the matter. In "Paradise Lost" he makes
our first parents "wind the Woodbine round this arbour"
(perhaps he had Shakespeare's arbour in his mind); and
in "Comus" he tells us of&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8h">"A bank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ivy-canopied, and interwove<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>While in "Lycidas" he tells of&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Musk Rose and the well-attired Woodbine."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And we can scarcely suppose that he would apply two such
contrary epithets as "flaunting" and "well-attired" to the
same plant. And now the name, as of old, is used with
great uncertainty, and I have heard it applied to many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>[<a href="./images/127.png">127</a>]</span>plants, and especially to the small sweet-scented Clematis
(<i>C. flammula</i>).</p>

<p>But with the Honeysuckle there is no such difficulty.
The name is an old one, and in its earliest use was no doubt
indifferently applied to many sweet-scented flowers (the
Primrose amongst them); but it was soon attached exclusively
to our own sweet Honeysuckle of the woods and
hedges. We have two native species (Lonicera periclymenum
and L. xylosteum), and there are about eighty exotic
species, but none of them sweeter or prettier than our own,
which, besides its fragrant flowers, has pretty, fleshy, red
fruit.</p>

<p>The Honeysuckle has ever been the emblem of firm and
fast affection&mdash;as it climbs round any tree or bush, that is
near it, not only clinging to it faster than Ivy, but keeping
its hold so tight as to leave its mark in deep furrows on the
tree that has supported it. The old writers are fond of
alluding to this. Bullein in "The Book of Simples," 1562,
says very prettily, "Oh, how swete and pleasant is Wood-binde,
in woodes or arbours, after a tender, soft rain: and
how friendly doe this herbe, if I maie so name it, imbrace
the bodies, armes, and branches of trees, with his long
winding stalkes, and tender leaves, openyng or spreading
forthe his swete Lillis, like ladie's fingers, em&#333;g the thornes
or bushes," and there is no doubt from the context that he
is here referring to the Honeysuckle. Chaucer gives the
crown of Woodbine to those who were constant in love&mdash;</p>

<p>We should scarcely expect such a lesson of wisdom drawn
from the simple herb-garden in the mouth of the greatest
knave and villain in the whole range of Shakespeare's writings.

<p>The Hyssop (<i>Hyssopus officinalis</i>) is not a British plant,
but it was held in high esteem in Shakespeare's time. Spenser

<p>and Gerard grew in his garden five or six different species
or varieties. He does not tell us where his plants came
from, and perhaps he did not know. It comes chiefly from
Austria and Siberia; yet Greene in his "Philomela," 1615,
speaks of "the Hyssop growing in America, that is liked of
strangers for the smell, and hated of the inhabitants for the
operation, being as prejudicial to the one as delightsome
to the other." It is now very little cultivated, for it is not a
plant of much beauty, and its medicinal properties are not
much esteemed; yet it is a plant that must always have an
interest to readers of the Bible; for there it comes before
us as the plant of purification, as the plant of which the
study was not beneath the wisdom of Solomon, and especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>[<a href="./images/129.png">129</a>]</span>as the plant that added to the cruelties of the Crucifixion.
Whether the Hyssop of Scripture is the Hyssopus officinalis
is still a question, but at the present time the most modern
research has decided that it is.</p>

<p>It is very possible that Shakespeare had no particular plant
in view, but simply referred to any of the many narcotic
plants which, when given in excess, would "take the reason
prisoner." The critics have suggested many plants&mdash;the
Hemlock, the Henbane, the Belladonna, the Mandrake, &amp;c.,
each one strengthening his opinion from coeval writers.
In this uncertainty I should incline to the Henbane from
the following description by Gerard and Lyte. "This herbe
is called .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of Apuleia-Mania" (Lyte). "Henbane is
called .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of Pythagoras, Zoroaster, and Apuleius, Insana"

<p>The rich evergreen of "the Ivy never sear" (Milton)
recommended it to the Romans to be joined with the Bay
in the chaplets of poets&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"Hanc sine tempora circum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inter victrices Hederam tibi serpere lauros."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Virgil.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"Seu condis amabile carmen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prima feres Heder&aelig; victricis pr&aelig;mia."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Horace.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And in medi&aelig;val times it was used with Holly for Christmas
decorations, so that Bullein called it "the womens Christmas
Herbe." But the old writers always assumed a curious
rivalry between the two&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Holly and Ivy made a great party<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Who should have the mastery<br /></span>
<span class="i3i">In lands where they go."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And there is a well-known carol of the time of Henry VI.,
which tells of the contest between the two, and of the
mastery of the Holly; it is in eight stanzas, of which I
extract the last four&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Holly he hath berries as red as any Rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The foresters, the hunters, keep them from the does;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Ivy she hath berries as black as any Sloe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">There come the owls and eat them as they go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Holly he hath birds, a full fair flock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The nightingale, the popinjay, the gentle laverock;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Good Ivy, say to us, what birds hast thou?<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">None but the owlet that cries 'How, how!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>[<a href="./images/131.png">131</a>]</span>
Thus the Ivy was not allowed the same honour inside the
houses of our ancestors as the Holly, but it held its place
outside the houses as a sign of good cheer to be had within.
The custom is now extinct, but formerly an Ivy bush (called
a tod of Ivy) was universally hung out in front of taverns in
England, as it still is in Brittany and Normandy. Hence
arose two proverbs&mdash;"Good wine needs no bush," <i>i.e.</i>, the
reputation is sufficiently good without further advertisement;
and "An owl in an Ivy bush," as "perhaps denoting originally
the union of wisdom or prudence with conviviality, as 'Be
merry and wise.'"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Nares.</span></p>

<p>The Ivy was a plant as much admired by our grandfathers
of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries as it is now by us.
Spenser was evidently fond of it&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And nigh thereto a little chappel stoode<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Wanton Yvie, flouring fayre."&mdash;<i>F. Q.</i>, ii, v, 29.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And in another place&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Amongst the rest the clambering Ivie grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Knitting his wanton armes with grasping hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Least that the Poplar happely should rew<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The erbe Ivie that groweth in our yard that mery is."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And in the same poem he prettily describes it as&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The pallid Ivie building his own bowre."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As a wild plant, the Ivy is found in Europe, Asia, and
Africa, but not in America, and wherever it is found it loves
to cover old walls and buildings, and trees of every sort,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>[<a href="./images/132.png">132</a>]</span>with its close and rich drapery and clusters of black fruit,<a name="FNanchor_132:1_106" id="FNanchor_132:1_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_132:1_106" class="fnanchor">[132:1]</a>
and where it once establishes itself it is always beautiful, but
not always harmless. Both on trees and buildings it requires
very close watching. It will very soon destroy soft-wooded
trees, such as the Poplar and the Ash, by its tight embrace,
not by sucking out the sap, but by preventing the outward
growth of the shoots, and checking&mdash;and at length preventing&mdash;the
flow of sap; and in buildings it is no doubt beneficial
as long as it is closely watched and kept in place, but
if allowed to drive its roots into joints, or to grow under
roofs, the swelling roots and branches will soon displace any
masonry, and cause immense mischief.</p>

<p>We have only one species of Ivy in England, and there
are only two real species recognized by present botanists,
but there are infinite varieties, and many of them very beautiful.
These variegated Ivies were known to the Greeks
and Romans, and were highly prized by them, one especially
with white fruit (at present not known) was the type
of beauty. No higher praise could be given to a beauty
than that she was "Hedera formosior alba." These varieties
are scarcely mentioned by Gerard and Parkinson, and probably
were not much valued; they are now in greater repute,
and nothing will surpass them for rapidly and effectually
covering any bare spaces.</p>

<p>I need scarcely add that the Ivy is so completely hardy
that it will grow in any aspect and in any soil; that its
flowers are the staple food of bees in the late autumn; and
that all the varieties grow easily from cuttings at almost any
time of the year.</p>

<p>The Knot-grass is the Polygonum aviculare, a British
weed, low, straggling, and many-jointed, hence its name of
Knot-grass. There is no doubt that this is the plant meant,
and its connection with a dwarf is explained by the belief,
probably derived from some unrecorded character detected
by the "doctrine of signatures," that the growth of children
could be stopped by a diet of Knot-grass. Steevens quotes
Beaumont and Fletcher to this effect, and this will probably
explain the epithet "hindering." But there may be another
explanation. Johnston tells us that in the north, "being
difficult to cut in the harvest time, or to pull in the process
of weeding, it has obtained the sobriquet of the Deil's-lingels."
From this it may well be called "hindering," just
as the Ononis, from the same habit of catching the plough and
harrow, has obtained the prettier name of "Rest-harrow."</p>

<p>But though Shakespeare's Knot-grass is undoubtedly the
Polygonum, yet the name was also given to another plant,
for this cannot be the plant mentioned by Milton&mdash;</p>

may be Agrostis stolonifera, as it is said to be in Aubrey's
"Natural History of Wilts" (Dr. Prior).</p>

<p>Lady-smocks are the flowers of Cardamine pratensis, the
pretty early meadow flower of which children are so fond,
and of which the popularity is shown by its many names:
Lady-smocks, Cuckoo-flower,<a name="FNanchor_134:1_107" id="FNanchor_134:1_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_134:1_107" class="fnanchor">[134:1]</a> Meadow Cress, Pinks, Spinks,
Bog-spinks, and May-flower, and "in Northfolke, Canterbury
Bells." The origin of the name is not very clear. It
is generally explained from the resemblance of the flowers
to smocks hung out to dry, but the resemblance seems to
me rather far-fetched. According to another explanation,
"the Lady-smock, a corruption of Our Lady's-smock, is so
called from its first flowering about Lady-tide. It is a pretty
purplish white, tetradynamous plant, which blows from Lady-tide
till the end of May, and which during the latter end of
April covers the moist meadows with its silvery-white, which
looks at a distance like a white sheet spread over the fields."&mdash;<i>Circle
of the Seasons.</i> Those who adopt this view called
the plant Our Lady's-smock, but I cannot find that name in
any old writers. Drayton, coeval with Shakespeare, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"Some to grace the show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Lady-smocks most white do rob each neighbouring mead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherewith their loose locks most curiously they braid."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And Isaac Walton, in the next century, drew that pleasant
picture of himself sitting quietly by the waterside&mdash;"looking
down the meadows I could see here a boy gathering Lilies
and Lady-smocks, and there a girl cropping Culverkeys and
Cowslips."<a name="FNanchor_134:2_108" id="FNanchor_134:2_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_134:2_108" class="fnanchor">[134:2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[<a href="./images/135.png">135</a>]</span>There is a double variety of the Lady-smock which makes
a handsome garden plant, and there is a remarkable
botanical curiosity connected with the plant which should
be noticed. The plant often produces in the autumn small
plants upon the leaves, and by the means of these little
parasites the plant is increased, and even if the leaves are
detached from the plant, and laid upon moist congenial
soil, young plants will be produced. This is a process that
is well known to gardeners in the propagation of Begonias,
and it is familiar to us in the proliferous Ferns, where young
plants are produced on the surface or tips of the fronds;
and Dr. Masters records "the same condition as a teratological
occurrence in the leaves of Hyacinthus Pouzolsii,
Drosera intermedia, Arabis pumila, Chelidonum majus,
Chirita Sinensis, Epicia bicolor, Zamia, &amp;c."&mdash;<i>Vegetable
Teratology</i>, p. 170.</p>

mentioned by Aubrey, in his "Natural History of Wilts;" but the name
is found in no other writer, and is now extinct. It is difficult to say what
plant is meant; many have been suggested: the Columbine, the Meadow
Orchis, the Bluebell, &amp;c. I think it must be the Meadow Geranium,
which is certainly "azor" almost beyond any other British plant.
"Culver" is a dove or pigeon, and "keyes" or "kayes" are the seeds
of a plant, and the seeds of the Geranium were all likened to the claws
of birds, so that our British species is called G. columbinum.</p></div>

<p>The mention of Lavender always recalls Walton's pleasant
picture of "an honest ale-house, where we shall find a
cleanly room, Lavender in the windows, and twenty ballads
stuck against the wall, and my hostess, I may tell you, is
both cleanly and handsome and civil." Whether it is from
this familiar, old-fashioned picture, or from some inherent
charm in the plant, it is hard to say, but it is certain that the
smell of Lavender is always associated with cleanliness and
freshness.<a name="FNanchor_137:1_110" id="FNanchor_137:1_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_137:1_110" class="fnanchor">[137:1]</a></p>

<p>It is not a British plant, but is a native of the South of
Europe in dry and barren places, and it was introduced into
England in the sixteenth century, but it probably was not a
common plant in Shakespeare's time, for though it is mentioned
by Spenser as "the Lavender still gray" ("Muiopotmos"),
and by Gerard as growing in his garden, it is not
mentioned by Bacon in his list of sweet-smelling plants.
The fine aromatic smell is found in all parts of the shrub,
but the essential oil is only produced from the flowers. As
a garden plant it is found in every garden, but its growth as
an extensive field crop is chiefly confined to the neighbourhood
of Mitcham and Carshalton in Surrey; and there at
the time of the picking of the flowers, and still more in the
later autumn when the old woody plants are burned, the air
for a long distance is strongly and most pleasantly impregnated
with the delicate perfume.</p>

<p>We can scarcely understand the very high value that was
placed on Leeks in olden times. By the Egyptians the plant
was almost considered sacred, "Porrum et c&aelig;pe nefas violare
et frangere morsu" (Juvenal); we know how Leeks were
relished in Egypt by the Israelites; and among the Greeks
they "appear to have constituted so important a part in
ancient gardens, that the term <ins class="greek" title="prasia">&#960;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#8049;</ins>, or a bed, derived its
name from <ins class="greek" title="prason">&#960;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#959;&#957;</ins>, the Greek word for Onion," or Leek<a name="FNanchor_138:1_111" id="FNanchor_138:1_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_138:1_111" class="fnanchor">[138:1]</a>
(Daubeny); while among the Anglo-Saxons it was very
much the same. The name is pure Anglo-Saxon, and
originally meant any vegetable; then it was restricted to any
bulbous vegetable, before it was finally further restricted to
our Leek; and "its importance was considered so much
above that of any other vegetable, that <i>leac-tun</i>, the Leek-garden,
became the common name of the kitchen garden,
and <i>leac-ward</i>, the Leek-keeper, was used to designate the
gardener" (Wright). The plant in those days gave its name
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>[<a href="./images/139.png">139</a>]</span>to the Broad Leek which is our present Leek, the Yne Leek
or Onion, the Garleek (Garlick), and others of the same tribe,
while it was applied to other plants of very different families,
as the Hollow Leek (<i>Corydalis cava</i>), and the House Leek
(<i>Sempervivum tectorum</i>).</p>

<p>It seems to have been considered the hardiest of all
flowers. In the account of the Great Frost of 1608, "this
one infallible token" is given in proof of its severity. "The
Leek whose courage hath ever been so undaunted that he
hath borne up his lusty head in all storms, and could never
be compelled to shrink for hail, snow, frost, or showers, is
now by the violence and cruelty of this weather beaten unto
the earth, being rotted, dead, disgraced, and trod upon."</p>

<p>Its popularity still continues among the Welsh, by whom
it is still, I believe, very largely cultivated; but it does not
seem to have been much valued in England in Shakespeare's
time, for Gerard has but little to say of its virtues, but much
of its "hurts." "It hateth the body, ingendreth naughty
blood, causeth troublesome and terrible dreames, offendeth
the eyes, dulleth the sight, &amp;c." Nor does Parkinson give
a much more favourable account. "Our dainty eye now
refuseth them wholly, in all sorts except the poorest; they
are used with us sometimes in Lent to make pottage, and is
a great and generall feeding in Wales with the vulgar
gentlemen." It was even used as the proverbial expression
of worthlessness, as in the "Roumaunt of the Rose," where
the author says, speaking of "Phiciciens and Advocates"&mdash;</p>

<p>Which is the queen of flowers? There are two rival
candidates for the honour&mdash;the Lily and the Rose; and as
we look on the one or the other, our allegiance is divided,
and we vote the crown first to one and then to the other.
We should have no difficulty "were t'other fair charmer
away," but with two such candidates, both equally worthy
of the honour, we vote for a diarchy instead of a monarchy,
and crown them both.<a name="FNanchor_142:1_113" id="FNanchor_142:1_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_142:1_113" class="fnanchor">[142:1]</a> Yet there are many that would at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>[<a href="./images/143.png">143</a>]</span>once choose the Lily for the queen, and that without hesitation,
and they would have good authority for their choice.
"O Lord, that bearest rule," says Esdras, "of the whole
world, Thou hast chosen Thee of all the flowers thereof one
Lily." Spenser addresses the Lily as&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Lily, lady of the flow'ring field"&mdash;<i>F. Q.</i>, ii, 6, 16,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which is the same as Shakespeare's "mistress of the field,"
(<a href="#Lily_8">8</a>), and many a poet since his time has given the same vote
in many a pretty verse, which, however, it would take too
much space to quote at length; so that I will content
myself with these few lines by Alexander Montgomery
(coeval with Shakespeare)&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I love the Lily as the first of flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i1i">Whose stately stalk so straight up is and stay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">To whom th' lave ay lowly louts and cowers<br /></span>
<span class="i1i">As bound so brave a beauty to obey."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Montgomery here has clearly in his mind's eye the Lily
now so called; but the name was not so restricted in the
earlier writers. "Lilium, cojus vox generali et licentiosa
usurpatione adscribitur omni flori commendabili" (Laurembergius,
1632). This was certainly the case with the Greek
and Roman writers, and it is so in our English Bible in most
of the cases where the word is used, but perhaps not universally
so. It is so used by Gower, describing Tarquin
cutting off the tall flowers, by some said to be Poppies and
by others Lilies&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And in the garden as they gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The Lilie croppes one and one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Where that they were sprongen out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">He smote off, as they stood about."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Conf. Ama.</i> lib. sept.</p>

<p>It is used in the same way by Bullein when, speaking of the
flower of the Honeysuckle (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#Honeysuckle">Honeysuckle</a></span>), and it must
have been used in the same sense by Isaak Walton, when
he saw a boy gathering "Lilies and Lady-smocks" in the
meadows.</p>

<p>We have still many records of this loose way of speaking
of the Lily, in the Water Lily, the Lily of the Valley, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>[<a href="./images/144.png">144</a>]</span>Lent Lily, St. Bruno's Lily, the Scarborough Lily, the Belladonna
Lily, and several others, none of which are true Lilies.</p>

<p>But it is time to come to Shakespeare's Lilies. In all
the twenty-eight passages the greater portion simply recall
the Lily as the type of elegance and beauty, without any
special reference to the flower, and in many the word is
only used to express a colour, Lily-white. But in the
others he doubtless had some special plant in view, and
there are two species which, from contemporary writers,
seem to have been most celebrated in his day. The one
is the pure White Lily (<i>Lilium candidum</i>), a plant of which
the native country is not yet quite accurately ascertained.
It is reported to grow wild in abundance in Lebanon, and
it probably came to England from the East in very early
times. It was certainly largely grown in Europe in the
Middle Ages, and was universally acknowledged by artists,
sculptors, and architects, as the emblem of female elegance
and purity, and none of us would dispute its claim to such
a position. There is no other Lily which can surpass it,
when well grown, in stateliness and elegance, with sweet-scented
flowers of the purest white and the most graceful
shape, and crowning the top of the long leafy stem with
such a coronal as no other plant can show. On the rare
beauties and excellences of the White Lily it would be easy
to fill a volume merely with extracts from old writers, and
such a volume would be far from uninteresting. Those
who wish for some such account may refer to the "Monographie
Historique et Litt&eacute;raire des Lis," par Fr. de Cannart
d'Hamale, 1870. There they will find more than fifty pages
of the botany, literary history, poetry, and medical uses of
the plant, together with its application to religious emblems,
numismatics, heraldry, painting, &amp;c. Two short extracts
will suffice here:&mdash;"Le lis blanc, surnomm&eacute; la fleur des
fleurs, les d&eacute;lices de Venus, la Rose de Junon, qu'Anguillara
d&eacute;signa sous le nom d'Ambrosia, probablement &agrave; cause de
son parfum suivant, et pent &ecirc;tre aussi de sa soidisante
divine origine, se place tout naturellement &agrave; le t&ecirc;te de ce
groupe splendide." "C'est le Lis classique, par excellence,
et en m&ecirc;me temps le plus beau du genre."</p>

<p>The other is the large Scarlet or Chalcedonian Lily; and
this also is one of the very handsomest, though its beauty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>[<a href="./images/145.png">145</a>]</span>is of a very different kind to the White Lily. The habit
of the plant is equally stately, and is indeed very grand,
but the colours are of the brightest and clearest red. These
two plants were abundantly grown in Shakespeare's time,
but besides these there do not seem to have been more
than about half-a-dozen species in cultivation. There
are now forty-six recognized species, besides varieties in
great number.</p>

<p>The Lily has a very wide geographical range, spreading
from Central Europe to the Philippines, and species are
found in all quarters of the globe, though the chief homes
of the family seem to be in California and Japan. Yet we
have no wild Lily in England. Both the Martagon and the
Pyrenean Lily have been found, but there is no doubt they
are garden escapes.</p>

<p>As a garden plant it may safely be said that no garden
can make any pretence to the name that cannot show a
good display of Lilies, many or few. Yet the Lily is a
most capricious plant; while in one garden almost any sort
will grow luxuriantly, in a neighbouring garden it is found
difficult to grow any in a satisfactory manner. Within the
last few years their culture has been much studied, and by
the practical knowledge of such great growers of the family
as G. F. Wilson, H. J. Elwes, and other kindred liliophilists,
we shall probably in a few years have many difficulties
cleared up both in the botanical history and the cultivation
of this lovely tribe.</p>

<p>But we cannot dismiss the Lily without a few words of
notice of its sacred character. It is the flower specially
dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and which is so familiar to
us in the old paintings of the Annunciation. But it has, of
course, a still higher character as a sacred plant from the
high honour placed on it by our Lord in the Sermon on the
Mount. After all that has been written on "the Lilies of
the field," critics have not yet decided whether any, and,
if so, what particular plant was meant. Each Eastern
traveller seems to have selected the flower that he most
admired in Palestine, and then to pronounce that that
must be the Lily referred to. Thus, at various times it has
been decided to be the Rose, the Crown Imperial, the
White Lily, the Chalcedonian Lily, the Oleander, the Wild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>[<a href="./images/146.png">146</a>]</span>Artichoke, the Sternbergia, the Tulip, and many others, but
the most generally received opinion now is, that if a true
Lily at all, the evidence runs most strongly in favour of the
L. Chalcedonicum; but that Dean Stanley's view is more
probably the correct one, that the term "Lily" is generic,
alluding to the many beautiful flowers, both of the Lily
family and others, which abound in Palestine. The question,
though deeply interesting, is not one for which we need to
be over-curious as to the true answer. All of us, and
gardeners especially, may be thankful for the words which
have thrown a never dying charm over our favourites, and
have effectually stopped any foolish objections that may be
brought against the deepest study of flowers, as a petty
study, with no great results. To any such silly objections
(and we often hear them) the answer is a very short and
simple one&mdash;that we have been bidden by the very highest
authority to "consider the Lilies."</p>

<p>It is only in comparatively modern times that the old
name of Line or Linden, or Lind,<a name="FNanchor_146:1_114" id="FNanchor_146:1_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_146:1_114" class="fnanchor">[146:1]</a> has given place to Lime.
The tree is a doubtful native, but has been long introduced,
perhaps by the Romans. It is a very handsome tree when
allowed room, but it bears clipping well, and so is very often
tortured into the most unnatural shapes. It was a very
favourite tree with our forefathers to plant in avenues, not
only for its rapid growth, but also for the delicious scent of
its flowers; but the large secretions of honey-dew which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>[<a href="./images/147.png">147</a>]</span>load the leaves, and the fact that it comes late into leaf and
sheds its leaves very early, have rather thrown it out of
favour of late years. As a useful tree it does not rank very
high, except for wood-carvers, who highly prize its light,
easily-cut wood, that keeps its shape, and is very little liable
to crack or split either in the working or afterwards. Nearly
all Grinling Gibbons' delicate carving is in Lime wood. To
gardeners the Lime is further useful as furnishing the
material for bast or bazen mats,<a name="FNanchor_147:1_115" id="FNanchor_147:1_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_147:1_115" class="fnanchor">[147:1]</a> which are made from
its bark, and interesting as being the origin of the name of
Linn&aelig;us.</p>

<p>If this be the correct reading (and not Long Heath) the
reference is to the Heather or Common Ling (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>).
This is the plant that is generally called Ling in the
South of England, but in the North of England the name is
given to the Cotton Grass (<i>Eriophorum</i>). It is very probable,
however, that no particular plant is intended, but that
it means any rough, wild vegetation, especially of open

<p>The Locust is the fruit of the Carob tree (<i>Ceratonia
siliqua</i>), a tree that grows naturally in many parts of the
South of Europe, the Levant, and Syria, and is largely cultivated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>[<a href="./images/148.png">148</a>]</span>for its fruit.<a name="FNanchor_148:1_116" id="FNanchor_148:1_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_148:1_116" class="fnanchor">[148:1]</a> These are like Beans, full of sweet pulp,
and are given in Spain and other southern countries to
horses, pigs, and cattle, and they are occasionally imported
into England for the same purpose. The Carob was cultivated
in England before Shakespeare's time. "They grow
not in this countrie," says Lyte, "yet, for all that, they be
sometimes in the gardens of some diligent Herboristes, but
they be so small shrubbes that they can neither bring forth
flowers nor fruite." It was also grown by Gerard, and
Shakespeare may have seen it; but it is now very seldom
seen in any collection, though the name is preserved among
us, as the jeweller's carat weight is said to have derived its
name from the Carob Beans, which were used for weighing
small objects.</p>

<p>The origin of the tree being called Locust is a little
curious. Readers of the New Testament, ignorant of
Eastern customs, could not understand that St. John could
feed on the insect locust, which, however, is now known to
be a common and acceptable article of food, so they looked
about for some solution of their difficulty, and decided that
the Locusts were the tender shoots of the Carob tree, and
that the wild honey was the luscious juice of the Carob fruit.
Having got so far it was easy to go farther, and so the Carob
soon got the names of St. John's Bread and St. John's
Beans, and the monks of the desert showed the very trees
by which St. John's life was supported. But though the
Carob tree did not produce the locusts on which St. John
fed, there is little or no doubt that "the husks which the
swine did eat," and which the Prodigal Son longed for,
were the produce of the Carob tree.</p>

In "Flowers from Stratford-on-Avon" (a pretty book published
a few years ago with plates of twelve of Shakespeare's
flowers) it is said that "there can be no doubt that the Wild
Arum is the plant alluded to by Shakespeare as forming part
of the nosegay of the crazed Ophelia;" but the authoress
gives no authority for this statement, and I believe that
there can be no reasonable doubt that the Long Purples and
Dead Men's Fingers are the common purple Orchises of the
woods and meadows (Orchis morio, O. mascula, and O.
maculata). The name of Dead Men's Fingers was given to
them from the pale palmate roots of some of the species (O.
latifolia, O. maculata, and Gymnadenia conopsea), and this
seems to have been its more common name.</p>

<p>As to the other names to which the Queen alludes, we
need not inquire too curiously; they are given in all their
"liberality" and "grossness" in the old Herbals, but as
common names they are, fortunately, extinct. The name
of Dead Men's Fingers still lingers in a few places, but
Long Purples has been transferred to a very different plant.
It is named by Clare and Tennyson&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>A Dirge</i>, <span class="smcap">Tennyson</span>.</p>

<p>But in both these passages the plant intended is the Lythrum
salicaria, or Purple Loosestrife.</p>

<p>The meadow Orchis, though so common, is thus without
any common English name; for though I have often asked
country people for its name, I have never obtained one;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>[<a href="./images/150.png">150</a>]</span>and so it is another of those curious instances which are so
hard to explain, where an old and common English word
has been replaced by a Greek or Latin word, which must
be entirely without meaning to nine-tenths of those who use
it.<a name="FNanchor_150:1_117" id="FNanchor_150:1_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_150:1_117" class="fnanchor">[150:1]</a> There are similar instances in Crocus, Cyclamen,
Hyacinth, Narcissus, Anemone, Beet, Lichen, Polyanthus,
Polypody, Asparagus, and others.</p>

<p>The Orchid family is certainly the most curious in the
vegetable kingdom, as it is almost the most extensive, except
the Grasses. Growing all over the world, in any climate,
and in all kinds of situations, it numbers 3000 species, of
which we have thirty-seven native species in England; and
with their curious irregular flowers, often of very beautiful
colours, and of wonderful quaintness and variety of shape,
they are everywhere so distinct that the merest tyro in
botany can separate them from any other flower, and the
deepest student can find endless puzzles in them, and increasing
interest.</p>

<p>Though the most beautiful are exotics, and are the chief
ornaments of our stoves and hothouses, yet our native species
are full of interest and beauty. Of their botanical interest
we have a most convincing proof in Darwin's "Fertilization
of Orchids," a book that is almost entirely confined to the
British Orchids, and which, in its wonderfully clear statements,
and its laborious collection of many little facts all
leading up to his scientific conclusions, is certainly not the
least to be admired among his other learned and careful
books. And as to their horticultural interest, it is most
surprising that so few gardeners make the use of them that
they might. They were not so despised in Shakespeare's
time, for Gerard grew a large number in his garden. It is
true that some of them are very impatient of garden cultivation,
especially those of the Ophrys section (such as the Bee,
Fly, and Spider Orchises), and the rare O. hircina, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>[<a href="./images/151.png">151</a>]</span>will seldom remain in the garden above two or three years,
except under very careful and peculiar cultivation. But, on
the other hand, there are many that rejoice in being transferred
to a garden, especially O. maculata, O. mascula, O.
pyramidalis, and the Butterfly Orchis of both kinds (Habenaria
bifolia and chlorantha). These, if left undisturbed,
increase in size and beauty every year, their flowers become
larger, and their leaves (in O. maculata and O. mascula)
become most beautifully spotted. They may be placed anywhere,
but their best place seems to be among low shrubs,
or on the rockwork. Nor must the hardy Orchid grower
omit the beautiful American species, especially the Cypripedia
(C. spectabile, C. pubescens, C. acaule, and others).
They are among the most beautiful of low hardy plants, and
they succeed perfectly in any peat border that is not too
much exposed to the sun. The only caution required is to
leave them undisturbed; they resent removal and broken
roots; and though I hold it to be one of the first rules of
good gardening to give away to others as much as possible,
yet I would caution any one against dividing his good clumps
of Cypripedia. The probability is that both giver and
receiver will lose the plants. If, however, a plant must be
divided, the whole plant should be carefully lifted, and most
gently pulled to pieces with the help of water.</p>

<p>The Mallow is the common roadside weed (<i>Malva sylvestris</i>),
which is not altogether useless in medicine, though
the Marsh Mallow far surpasses it in this respect. Ben
Jonson speaks of it as an article of food&mdash;</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The thresher .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. feeds on Mallows and such bitter herbs."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>The Fox</i>, act i, sc. 1.</p>

<p>It is not easy to believe that our common Wild Mallow was
so used, and Jonson probably took the idea from Horace&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Me pascant oliv&aelig;,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Me chichorea, levesque malv&aelig;."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the common Mallow is a dear favourite with children,
who have ever loved to collect, and string, and even
eat its "cheeses:" and these cheeses are a delight to
others besides children. Dr. Lindley, certainly one of
the most scientific of botanists, can scarcely find words
to express his admiration of them. "Only compare a
vegetable cheese," he says, "with all that is exquisite in
marking and beautiful in arrangement in the works of man,
and how poor and contemptible do the latter appear.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Nor is it alone externally that this inimitable beauty is to be
discovered; cut the cheese across, and every slice brings to
view cells and partitions, and seeds and embryos, arranged
with an unvarying regularity, which would be past belief if
we did not know from experience, how far beyond all that
the mind can conceive, is the symmetry with which the
works of Nature are constructed."</p>

<p>As a garden plant of course the Wild Mallow has no place,
though the fine-cut leaves and faint scent of the Musk
Mallow (<i>M. moschata</i>) might demand a place for it in those
parts where it is not wild, and especially the white variety,
which is of the purest white, and very ornamental. But
our common Mallow is closely allied to some of the handsomest
plants known. The Hollyhock is one very near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>[<a href="./images/153.png">153</a>]</span>relation, the beautiful Hibiscus is another, and the very
handsome Fremontia Californica is a third that has only
been added to our gardens during the last few years. Nor
is it only allied to beauty, for it also claims as a very near
relation a plant which to many would be considered the
most commercially useful plant in the world, the Cotton-plant.</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, no plant on which so many books and
treatises (containing for the most part much sad nonsense)
have been written as the Mandrake, and there is certainly
no plant round which so much superstition has gathered, all
of which is more or less silly and foolish, and a great deal
that is worse than silly. This, no doubt, arose from its first
mention in connection with Leah and Rachel, and then in
the Canticles, which, perhaps, shows that even in those days
some strange qualities were attributed to the plant; but how
from that beginning such, and such wide-spread, superstitions
could have arisen, it is hard to say. I can scarcely tell
these superstitious fables in better words than Gerard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>[<a href="./images/154.png">154</a>]</span>described them: "There hath been many ridiculous tales
brought up of this plant, whether of old wives or some
runagate surgeons or physicke-mongers I know not.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They
adde that it is never or very seldome to be found
growing naturally but under a gallowes, where the matter
that has fallen from a dead body hath given it the shape of
a man, and the matter of a woman the substance of a
female plant, with many other such doltish dreams. They
fable further and affirme that he who would take up a
plant thereof must tie a dog thereunto to pull it up, which
will give a great shreeke at the digging up, otherwise, if a
man should do it, he should surely die in a short space
after." This, with the addition that the plant is decidedly
narcotic, will sufficiently explain all Shakespeare's references.
Gerard, however, omits to notice one thing which, in justice
to our forefathers, should not be omitted. These fables on
the Mandrake are by no means English medi&aelig;val fables,
but they were of foreign extraction, and of very ancient date.
Josephus tells the same story as held by the Jews in his
time and before his time. Columella even spoke of the
plant as "semi-homo;" and Pythagoras called it "Anthropomorphus;"
and Dr. Daubeny has published in his "Roman
Husbandry" a most curious drawing from the Vienna MS.
of Dioscorides in the fifth century, "representing the
Goddess of Discovery presenting to Dioscorides the root of
this Mandrake" (of thoroughly human shape) "which she
had just pulled up, while the unfortunate dog which had
been employed for that purpose is depicted in the agonies
of death."<a name="FNanchor_154:1_118" id="FNanchor_154:1_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_154:1_118" class="fnanchor">[154:1]</a> All these beliefs have long, I should hope,
been extinct among us; yet even now artists who draw the
plant are tempted to fancy a resemblance to the human
figure, and in the "Flora Gr&aelig;ca," where, for the most part,
the figures of the plants are most beautifully accurate, the
figure of the Mandrake is painfully human.<a name="FNanchor_154:2_119" id="FNanchor_154:2_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_154:2_119" class="fnanchor">[154:2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>[<a href="./images/155.png">155</a>]</span>
As a garden plant, the Mandrake is often grown, but more
for its curiosity than its beauty; the leaves appear early in
the spring, followed very soon by its dull and almost inconspicuous
flowers, and then by its Apple-like fruit. This
is the Spring Mandrake (<i>Mandragora vernalis</i>), but the
Autumn Mandrake (<i>M. autumnalis</i> or <i>microcarpa</i>) may be
grown as an ornamental plant. The leaves appear in the
autumn, and are succeeded by a multitude of pale-blue
flowers about the size of and very much resembling the
Anemone pulsatilla (see Sweet's "Flower Garden," vol. vii.
No. 325). These remain in flower a long time. In my
own garden they have been in flower from the beginning of
November till May. I need only add that the Mandrake is
a native of the South of Europe and other countries bordering
on the Mediterranean, but it was very early introduced into
England. It is named in Archbishop &AElig;lfric's "Vocabulary"
in the tenth century with the very expressive name of "Earth-apple;"
it is again named in an Anglo-Saxon Vocabulary of
the eleventh century (in the British Museum), but without
any English equivalent; and Gerard cultivated both sorts
in his garden.</p>

<p>There are at least three plants which claim to be the old
Marigold. 1. The Marsh Marigold (<i>Caltha palustris</i>). This
is a well-known golden flower&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The wild Marsh Marigold shines like fire in swamps and hollows gray."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorscpoem">Tennyson.</p>

<p>And there is this in favour of its being the flower meant,
that the name signifies the golden blossom of the marish or
marsh; but, on the other hand, the Caltha does not fulfil
the conditions of Shakespeare's Marigold&mdash;it does not open
and close its flowers with the sun. 2. The Corn Marigold
(<i>Chrysanthemum segetum</i>), a very handsome but mischievous
weed in Corn-fields, not very common in England and said
not to be a true native, but more common in Scotland, where
it is called Goulands. I do not think this is the flower,
because there is no proof, as far as I know, that it was called
Marigold in Shakespeare's time. 3. The Garden Marigold
or Ruddes (<i>Calendula officinalis</i>). I have little doubt this
is the flower meant; it was always a great favourite in our
forefathers' gardens, and it is hard to give any reason why
it should not be so in ours. Yet it has been almost completely
banished, and is now seldom found but in the gardens
of cottages and old farmhouses, where it is still prized for
its bright and almost everlasting flowers (looking very like a
Gazania) and evergreen tuft of leaves, while the careful
housewife still picks and carefully stores the petals of the
flowers, and uses them in broths and soups, believing them
to be of great efficacy, as Gerard said they were, "to
strengthen and comfort the heart;" though scarcely perhaps
rating them as high as Fuller: "we all know the many and
sovereign vertues .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in your leaves, the Herb Generall in
all pottage" ("Antheologie," 1655, p. 52).</p>

<p>The two properties of the Marigold&mdash;that it was always in
flower, and that it turned its flowers to the sun and followed
his guidance in their opening and shutting&mdash;made it a very
favourite flower with the poets and emblem writers. T.
Forster, in the "Circle of the Seasons," 1828, says that
"this plant received the name of Calendula, because it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>[<a href="./images/157.png">157</a>]</span>in flower on the calends of nearly every month. It has
been called Marigold for a similar reason, being more or
less in blow at the times of all the festivals of the Blessed
Virgin Mary, the word gold having reference to its golden
rays, likened to the rays of light around the head of the
Blessed Virgin." This is ingenious, and, as he adds, "thus
say the old writers," it is worth quoting, though he does not
say what old writer gave this derivation, which I am very
sure is not the true one. The old name is simply <i>goldes</i>.
Gower, describing the burning of Leucothoe, says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>But it was its other quality of opening or shutting its
flowers at the sun's bidding that made the Marigold such a
favourite with the old writers, especially those who wrote on
religious emblems. It was to them the emblem of constancy
in affection,<a name="FNanchor_157:2_121" id="FNanchor_157:2_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_157:2_121" class="fnanchor">[157:2]</a> and sympathy in joy and sorrow, though it was
also the emblem of the fawning courtier, who can only shine
when everything is bright. As the emblem of constancy, it
was to the old writers what the Sunflower was to Moore&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>[<a href="./images/158.png">158</a>]</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Sunflower turns on her god when he sets<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The same look which she did when he rose."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was the Heliotrope or Solsequium or Turnesol of our
forefathers, and is the flower often alluded to under that
name.<a name="FNanchor_158:1_122" id="FNanchor_158:1_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_158:1_122" class="fnanchor">[158:1]</a> "All yellow flowers," says St. Francis de Sales, "and,
above all, those that the Greeks call Heliotrope, and we call
Sunflower, not only rejoice at the sight of the sun, but follow
with loving fidelity the attraction of its rays, gazing at the
sun, and turning towards it from its rising to its setting"
("Divine Love," Mulholland's translation).</p>

<p>Of this higher and more religious use of the emblematic
flower there are frequent examples. I will only give one
from G. Withers, a contemporary of Shakespeare's later life&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When with a serious musing I behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The grateful and obsequious Marigold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">How duly every morning she displays<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Her open breast when Ph&oelig;bus spreads his rays;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">How she observes him in his daily walk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Still bending towards him her small slender stalk;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">How when he down declines she droops and mourns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Bedewed, as 'twere, with tears till he returns;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And how she veils her flowers when he is gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">When this I meditate, methinks the flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Have spirits far more generous than ours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And give us fair examples to despise<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The servile fawnings and idolatries<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Wherewith we court these earthly things below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Which merit not the service we bestow."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From the time of Withers the poets treated the Marigold
very much as the gardeners did&mdash;they passed it by altogether
as beneath their notice.</p>

<p>In Shakespeare's time several species of Marjoram were
grown, especially the Common Marjoram (<i>Origanum vulgare</i>),
a British plant, the Sweet Marjoram (<i>O. Marjorana</i>), a plant
of the South of Europe, from which the English name comes,<a name="FNanchor_159:1_123" id="FNanchor_159:1_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_159:1_123" class="fnanchor">[159:1]</a>
and the Winter Marjoram (<i>O. Horacleoticum</i>). They were
all favourite pot herbs, so that Lyte calls the common one
"a delicate and tender herb," "a noble and odoriferous
plant;" but, like so many of the old herbs, they have now
fallen into disrepute. The comparison of a man's hair to the
buds of Marjoram is not very intelligible, but probably it
was a way of saying that the hair was golden.</p>

<p>The Medlar is an European tree, but not a native of England;
it has, however, been so long introduced as to be now
completely naturalized, and is admitted into the English
flora. It is mentioned in the early vocabularies, and Chaucer
gives it a very prominent place in his description of a beautiful
garden&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I was aware of the fairest Medler tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">That ever yet in alle my life I sie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">As ful of blossomes as it might be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Therein a goldfinch leaping pretile<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Fro' bough to bough, and as him list, he eet<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Here and there of buddes and floweres sweet."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>The Flower and the Leaf</i> (240).</p>

<p>And certainly a fine Medlar tree "ful of blossomes" is a
handsome ornament on any lawn. There are few deciduous
trees that make better lawn trees. There is nothing stiff
about the growth even from its early youth; it forms a low,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>[<a href="./images/161.png">161</a>]</span>irregular, picturesque tree, excellent for shade, with very
handsome white flowers, followed by the curious fruit; it will
not, however, do well in the North of England or Scotland.</p>

<p>It does not seem to have been a favourite fruit with our
forefathers. Bullein says "the fruite called the Medler is used
for a medicine and not for meate;" and Shakespeare only
used the common language of his time when he described
the Medlar as only fit to be eaten when rotten. Chaucer
said just the same&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"That ilke fruyt is ever lenger the wers<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Till it be rote in mullok or in stree&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">We olde men, I drede, so fare we,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Till we be roten, can we not be rype."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>The Reeves Tale.</i></p>

<p>And many others writers to the same effect. But, in fact, the
Medlar when fit to be eaten is no more rotten than a ripe
Peach, Pear, or Strawberry, or any other fruit which we do
not eat till it has reached a certain stage of softness. There
is a vast difference between a ripe and a rotten Medlar, though
it would puzzle many of us to say when a fruit (not a Medlar
only) is ripe, that is, fit to be eaten. These things are
matters of taste and fashion, and it is rather surprising to find
that we are accused, and by good judges, of eating Peaches
when rotten rather than ripe. "The Japanese always eat
their Peaches in an unripe state. In the 'Gartenflora' Dr.
Regel says, in some remarks on Japanese fruit trees, that the
Japanese regard a ripe Peach as rotten."</p>

<p>There are a few varieties of the Medlar, differing in the
size and flavour of the fruits, which were also cultivated in
Shakespeare's time.</p>

<p>The Mistletoe was a sore puzzle to our ancestors, almost
as great a mystery as the Fern. While they admired its
fresh, evergreen branches, and pretty transparent fruit, and
used it largely in the decoration of their houses at Christmas,
they looked on the plant with a certain awe. Something of
this, no doubt, arose from its traditional connection with the
Druids, which invested the plant with a semi-sacred character,
as a plant that could drive away evil spirits; yet it was also
looked upon with some suspicion, perhaps also arising from
its use by our heathen ancestors, so that, though admitted
into houses, it was not (or very seldom) admitted into churches.
And this character so far still attaches to the Mistletoe,
that it is never allowed with the Holly and Ivy and Box
to decorate the churches, and Gay's lines were certainly
written in error&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now with bright Holly all the temples strow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">With Laurel green and sacred Mistletoe."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The mystery attaching to the Mistletoe arose from the
ignorance as to its production. It was supposed not to
grow from its seeds, and how it was produced was a fit
subject for speculation and fable. Virgil tells the story
thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Quale solet sylvis brumali frigore viscum<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Fronde virere nov&acirc;, quod non sua seminat arbos,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Et croceo f&oelig;tu teretes circumdare truncos."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>&AElig;neid</i>, vi, 205.</p>

<p>In this way Virgil elegantly veils his ignorance, but his
commentator in the eighteenth century (Delphic Classics)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>[<a href="./images/163.png">163</a>]</span>tells the tale without any doubts as to its truth. "Non
nascitur e semine proprio arboris, at neque ex insidentum
volucrum fimo, ut putavere veteres, sed ex ipso arborum
vitali excremento." This was the opinion of the great Lord
Bacon; he ridiculed the idea that the Mistletoe was propagated
by the operation of a bird as an idle tradition, saying
that the sap which produces the plant is such as "the tree
doth excerne and cannot assimilate," and Browne ("Vulgar
Errors") was of the same opinion. But the opposite
opinion was perpetuated in the very name ("Mistel: fimus,
muck," Cockayne),<a name="FNanchor_163:1_125" id="FNanchor_163:1_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_163:1_125" class="fnanchor">[163:1]</a> and was held without any doubt by
most of the writers in Shakespeare's time&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Upon the oak, the plumb-tree and the holme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The stock-dove and the blackbird should not come,<br /></span>

<p>So that we need not blame Gerard when he boldly said
that "this excrescence hath not any roote, neither doth
encrease himselfe of his seed, as some have supposed, but
it rather commethe of a certaine moisture gathered together
upon the boughes and joints of the trees, through the barke
whereof this vaporous moisture proceeding bringeth forth
the Misseltoe." We now know that it is produced exclusively
from the seeds probably lodged by the birds, and
that it is easily grown and cultivated. It will grow and has
been found on almost any deciduous tree, preferring those
with soft bark, and growing very seldom on the Oak.<a name="FNanchor_163:2_126" id="FNanchor_163:2_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_163:2_126" class="fnanchor">[163:2]</a>

<p>If it were not for the pretty notice of Moss in the last
passage (<a href="#Moss_6">6</a>), we should be inclined to say that Shakespeare
had as little regard for "idle Moss" as for the "baleful
Mistletoe." In his day Moss included all the low-growing
and apparently flowerless carpet plants which are now
divided into the many families of Mosses, Lichens, Club
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>[<a href="./images/165.png">165</a>]</span>Mosses, Hepatic&aelig;, Jungermanni&aelig;, &amp;c., &amp;c. And these
plants, though holding no rank in the eyes of a florist, are
yet deeply interesting, perhaps no family of plants more so,
to those who have time and patience to study them. The
Club Mosses, indeed, may claim a place in the garden
if they can only be induced to grow, but that is a difficult
task, and the tenderer Lycopodiums are always favourites
when well grown among greenhouse Ferns; but for the
most part, the Mosses must be studied in their native
haunts, and when so studied, they are found to be full
of beauty and of wonderful construction. Nor are they
without use, and it is rather strange that Shakespeare should
have so markedly called them "idle," or useless, considering
that in his day many medical virtues were attributed
to them. This reputation for medical virtues they have
now all lost, except the Iceland Moss, which is still in use
for invalids; but the Mosses have other uses. The Reindeer
Moss (<i>Cladonia rangiferina</i>) and Roch-hair (<i>Alectoria
jubata</i>) are indispensable to the Laplander as food for his
reindeer, and Usnea florida is used in North America as
food for cattle; the Iceland Moss (<i>Cetraria Islandica</i>) is
equally indispensable as an article of food to all the inhabitants
of the extreme North; and the Tripe de la Roche (<i>Gyrophora
cylindrica</i>) has furnished food to the Arctic explorers
when no other food could be obtained; while many dyes
are produced from the Lichens, especially the Cudbear
(a most discordant corruption of the name of the discoverer,
Mr. Cuthbert), which is the produce of the Rock Moss
(<i>Lecanora tartarea</i>). So that even to us the Mosses have
their uses, even if they do not reach the uses that they
have in North Sweden, where, according to Miss Bremer,
"the forest, which is the countryman's workshop, is his
storehouse, too. With the various Lichens that grow upon
the trees and rocks, he cures the virulent diseases with
which he is sometimes afflicted, dyes the articles of clothes
which he wears, and poisons the noxious and dangerous
animals which annoy him."</p>

<p>As to the beauty of Mosses and Lichens we have only to
ask any artist or go into any exhibition of pictures. Their
great beauty has been so lovingly described by Ruskin
("Modern Painters"), that no one can venture to do more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>[<a href="./images/166.png">166</a>]</span>than quote his description. It is well known to many, but
none will regret having it called to their remembrance&mdash;"placuit
semel&mdash;decies repetita placebit"&mdash;space, however,
will oblige me somewhat to curtail it. "Meek creatures!
the first mercy of the earth, veiling with hushed softness its
dentless rocks: creatures full of pity, covering with strange
and tender honour the sacred disgrace of ruin, laying quiet
fingers on the trembling stones to teach them rest. No
words that I know of will say what these Mosses are; none
are delicate enough, none perfect enough, none rich enough.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They
will not be gathered like the flowers for chaplet
or love token; but of these the wild bird will make its nest
and the wearied child its pillow, and as the earth's first
mercy so they are its last gift to us. When all other service
is vain from plant and tree, the soft Mosses and grey Lichens
take up their watch by the headstone. The woods, the
blossoms, the gift-bearing Grasses have done their parts for
a time, but these do service for ever. Trees for the builder's
yard, flowers for the bride's chamber, Corn for the granary,
Moss for the grave."</p>

<p>We do not know when the Mulberry, which is an Eastern
tree, was introduced into England, but probably very early.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>[<a href="./images/167.png">167</a>]</span>We find in Archbishop &AElig;lfric's "Vocabulary," "morus vel
rubus, mor-beam," but it is doubtful whether that applies to
the Mulberry or Blackberry, as in the same catalogue Blackberries
are mentioned as "flavi vel mori, blace-berian."
There is no doubt that Morum was a Blackberry as well as
a Mulberry in classical times. Our Mulberry is probably
the fruit mentioned by Horace&mdash;</p>

we find, "Hec sunt nomina silvestrium arborum, qui sunt in
luco magistri Johannis; quercus cum fago, pinus cum lauro,
celsus gerens celsa;" and Mr. Wright translates "celsa" by
"Mulberries," without, however, giving his authority for this
translation.<a name="FNanchor_167:2_129" id="FNanchor_167:2_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_167:2_129" class="fnanchor">[167:2]</a> But whenever introduced, it had been long
established in England in Shakespeare's time.</p>

<p>It must have been a common tree even in Anglo-Saxon
times, for the favourite drink, Morat, was a compound of
honey flavoured with Mulberries (Turner's "Anglo-Saxons").<a name="FNanchor_167:3_130" id="FNanchor_167:3_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_167:3_130" class="fnanchor">[167:3]</a>

<p>Gerard describes it as "high and full of boughes," and
growing in sundry gardens in England, and he grew in his
own London garden both the Black and the White Mulberry.
Lyte also, before Gerard, describes it and says: "It is called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>[<a href="./images/168.png">168</a>]</span>in the fayning of Poetes the wisest of all other trees, for this
tree only among all others bringeth forth his leaves after the
cold frostes be past;" and the Mulberry Garden, often mentioned
by the old dramatists, "occupied the site of the present
Buckingham Palace and Gardens, and derived its name
from a garden of Mulberry trees planted by King James I.
in 1609, in which year 935<i>l.</i> was expended by the king in
the planting of Mulberry trees near the Palace of Westminster."<a name="FNanchor_168:1_131" id="FNanchor_168:1_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_168:1_131" class="fnanchor">[168:1]</a></p>

<p>As an ornamental tree for any garden, the Mulberry needs
no recommendation, being equally handsome in shape, in
foliage, and in fruit. It is a much prized ornament in all old
gardens, so that it has been well said that an old Mulberry
tree on the lawn is a patent of nobility to any garden; and it
is most easy of cultivation; it will bear removal when of a
considerable size, and so easily can it be propagated from
cuttings that a story is told of Mr. Payne Knight that he cut
large branches from a Mulberry tree to make standards for
his clothes-lines, and that each standard took root, and
became a flourishing Mulberry tree.</p>

<p>Though most of us only know of the common White or
Black Mulberry, yet, where it is grown for silk culture (as it
is now proposed to grow it in England, with a promised profit
of from &pound;70 to &pound;100 per acre for the silk, and an additional
profit of from &pound;100 to &pound;500 per acre from the grain
(eggs)!!), great attention is paid to the different varieties; so
that M. de Quatrefuges briefly describes six kinds cultivated
in one valley in France, and Royle remarks, "so many
varieties have been produced by cultivation that it is difficult
to ascertain whether they all belong to one species; they
are," as he adds, "nearly as numerous as those of the silkworm"
(Darwin).</p>

<p>We have good proof of Shakespeare's admiration of the
Mulberry in the celebrated Shakespeare Mulberry growing in
his garden at New Place at Stratford-on-Avon. "That Shakespeare
planted this tree is as well authenticated as anything
of that nature can be, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and till this was planted there
was no Mulberry tree in the neighbourhood. The tree was
celebrated in many a poem, one especially by Dibdin, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>[<a href="./images/169.png">169</a>]</span>about 1752, the then owner of New Place, the Rev. Mr.
Gastrell, bought and pulled down the house, and wishing, as
it should seem, to be 'damned to everlasting fame,' he had
some time before cut down Shakespeare's celebrated Mulberry
tree, to save himself the trouble of showing it to those
whose admiration of our great poet led them to visit the
poetick ground on which it stood."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Malone.</span> The pieces
were made into many snuff-boxes<a name="FNanchor_169:1_132" id="FNanchor_169:1_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_169:1_132" class="fnanchor">[169:1]</a> and other mementoes of

The three first passages, besides the notice of the Mushroom,
contain also the notice of the fairy-rings, which are
formed by fungi, though probably Shakespeare knew little
of this. No. <a href="#Mushroom_4">4</a> names the Toadstool, and the four passages
together contain the whole of Shakespeare's fungology, and
it is little to be wondered at that he has not more to say on
these curious plants. In his time "Mushrumes or Toadstooles"
(they were all classed together) were looked on
with very suspicious eyes, though they were so much eaten
that we frequently find in the old herbals certain remedies
against "a surfeit of Mushrooms." Why they should have
been connected with toads has never been explained, but it
was always so&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The grieslie Todestoole growne there mought I see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And loathed paddocks lording on the same."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Spenser.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They were associated with other loathsome objects besides
toads, for "Poisonous Mushrooms groweth where old
rusty iron lieth, or rotten clouts, or neere to serpent's dens
or rootes of trees that bring forth venomous fruit.<a name="FNanchor_170:1_133" id="FNanchor_170:1_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_170:1_133" class="fnanchor">[170:1]</a> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Few
of them are good to be eaten, and most of them do
suffocate and strangle the eater. Therefore, I give my
advice unto those that love such strange and new-fangled
meates to beware of licking honey among thornes, lest the
sweetnesse of one do not counteracte the sharpnesse and
pricking of the other." This was Gerard's prudent advice
on the eating of "Mushrumes and Toadstooles," but nowadays
we know better. The fungologists tell us that those
who refuse to eat any fungus but the Mushroom (<i>Agaricus
campestris</i>) are not only foolish in rejecting most delicate
luxuries, but also very wrong in wasting most excellent and
nutritious food. Fungologists are great enthusiasts, and it
may be well to take their prescription <i>cum grano salis</i>; but
we may qualify Gerard's advice by the well-known enthusiastic
description of Dr. Badham, who certainly knew much
more of fungology than Gerard, and did not recommend
to others what he had not personally tried himself. After
praising the beauty of an English autumn, even in comparison
with Italy, he thus concludes his pleasant and useful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>[<a href="./images/171.png">171</a>]</span>book, "The Esculent Funguses of England": "I have myself
witnessed whole hundredweights of rich, wholesome diet
rotting under trees, woods teeming with food, and not one
hand to gather it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have, indeed, grieved when I reflected
on the straitened conditions of the lower orders to see
pounds innumerable of extempore beefsteaks growing on
our Oaks in the shape of <i>Fistula hepatica</i>; <i>Ag. fusipes</i>, to
pickle in clusters under them; <i>Puffballs</i>, which some of our
friends have not inaptly compared to sweet-bread for the
rich delicacy of their unassisted flavour; <i>Hydna</i>, as good as
oysters, which they very much resemble in taste; <i>Agaricus
deliciosus</i>, reminding us of tender lamb's kidneys: the beautiful
yellow <i>Chantarelle</i>, that <i>kalon kagathon</i> of diet, growing
by the bushel, and no basket but our own to pick up a few
specimens in our way; the sweet nutty-flavoured <i>Boletus</i>, in
vain calling himself <i>edulis</i> when there was none to believe
him; the dainty <i>Orcella</i>; the <i>Ag. hetherophyllus</i>, which
tastes like the crawfish when grilled; the <i>Ag. ruber</i> and <i>Ag.
virescens</i>, to cook in any way, and equally good in all."</p>

<p>As to the fairy rings (Nos. <a href="#Mushroom_1">1</a>, <a href="#Mushroom_2">2</a>, and <a href="#Mushroom_3">3</a>) a great amount of
legendary lore was connected with them. Browne notices
them&mdash;</p>

besides the sheep, avoided them. "When the damsels of
old gathered may-dew on the grass, which they made use of
to improve their complexions, they left undisturbed such of
it as they perceived on the fairy rings, apprehensive that the
fairies should in revenge destroy their beauty, nor was it
reckoned safe to put the foot within the rings, lest they
should be liable to fairies' power."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Douce's</span> <i>Illustrations</i>,

<p>The following passage from Coles, in 1657, will illustrate
No. <a href="#Mustard_1">1</a>: "In Gloucestershire about Teuxbury they grind
Mustard and make it into balls which are brought to London
and other remote places as being the best that the world
affords." These Mustard balls were the form in which
Mustard was usually sold, until Mrs. Clements, of Durham,
in the last century, invented the method of dressing mustard-flour,
like wheat-flour, and made her fortune with
Durham Mustard; and it has been supposed that this was
the only form in which Mustard was sold in Shakespeare's
time, and that it was eaten dry as we eat pepper. But the
following from an Anglo-Saxon Leech-book seems to speak
of it as used exactly in the modern fashion. After mentioning
several ingredients in a recipe for want of appetite
for meat, it says: "Triturate all together&mdash;eke out with
vinegar as may seem fit to thee, so that it may be wrought
into the form in which Mustard is tempered for flavouring,
put it then into a glass vessel, and then with bread, or with
whatever meat thou choose, lap it with a spoon, that will
help" ("Leech Book," ii. 5, Cockayne's translation). And
Parkinson's account is to the same effect: "The seeds
hereof, ground between two stones, fitted for the purpose,
and called a quern, with some good vinegar added to it to
make it liquid and running, is that kind of Mustard that is
usually made of all sorts to serve as sauce both for fish and
flesh." And to the same effect the "Boke of Nurture"&mdash;</p>

<p>Myrtle is of course the English form of <i>myrtus</i>; but the
older English name was Gale, a name which is still applied
to the bog-myrtle.<a name="FNanchor_174:1_134" id="FNanchor_174:1_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_174:1_134" class="fnanchor">[174:1]</a> Though a most abundant shrub in the
South of Europe, and probably introduced into England
before the time of Shakespeare, the myrtle was only grown
in a very few places, and was kept alive with difficulty, so
that it was looked upon not only as a delicate and an elegant
rarity, but as the established emblem of refined beauty. In
the Bible it is always associated with visions and representations
of peacefulness and plenty, and Milton most fitly uses
it in the description of our first parents' "blissful bower"&mdash;</p>

<p>As a garden shrub every one will grow the Myrtle that
can induce it to grow. There is no difficulty in its cultivation,
provided only that the climate suits it, and the climate that
suits it best is the neighbourhood of the sea. Virgil describes
the Myrtles as "amantes littora myrtos," and those who have
seen the Myrtle as it grows on the Devonshire and Cornish
coasts will recognise the truth of his description.</p>

<p>The Nettle needs no introduction; we are all too well
acquainted with it, yet it is not altogether a weed to be
despised. We have two native species (Urtica urens and U.
dioica) with sufficiently strong qualities, but we have a third
(U. pilulifera) very curious in its manner of bearing its female
flowers in clusters of compact little balls, which is far more
virulent than either of our native species, and is said by
Camden to have been introduced by the Romans to chafe
their bodies when frozen by the cold of Britain. The story
is probably quite apocryphal, but the plant is an alien, and
only grows in a few places.</p>

<p>Both the Latin and English names of the plant record its
qualities. Urtica is from <i>uro</i>, to burn; and Nettle is (etymologically)
the same word as needle, and the plant is so
named, not for its stinging qualities, but because at one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>[<a href="./images/177.png">177</a>]</span>time the Nettle supplied the chief instrument of sewing; not
the instrument which holds the thread, and to which we now
confine the word needle, but the thread itself, and very good
thread it made. The poet Campbell says in one of his
letters&mdash;"I have slept in Nettle sheets, and dined off a
Nettle table-cloth, and I have heard my mother say that she
thought Nettle cloth more durable than any other linen."
It has also been used for making paper, and for both these
purposes, as well as for rope-making, the Rhea fibre of the
Himalaya, which is simply a gigantic Nettle (<i>Urtica</i> or
<i>B&ouml;hmeria nivea</i>), is very largely cultivated. Nor is the
Nettle to be despised as an article of food.<a name="FNanchor_177:1_136" id="FNanchor_177:1_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_177:1_136" class="fnanchor">[177:1]</a> In many parts
of England the young shoots are boiled and much relished.
In 1596 Coghan wrote of it: "I will speak somewhat of the
Nettle that Gardeners may understand what wrong they do
in plucking it for the weede, seeing it is so profitable to
many purposes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Cunning cookes at the spring of the
yeare, when Nettles first bud forth, can make good pottage
with them, especially with red Nettles" ("Haven of Health,"
p. 86). In February, 1661, Pepys made the entry in his
diary&mdash;"We did eat some Nettle porridge, which was made
on purpose to-day for some of their coming, and was very
good." Andrew Fairservice said of himself&mdash;"Nae doubt I
should understand my trade of horticulture, seeing I was
bred in the Parish of Dreepdaily, where they raise lang Kale
under glass, and force the early Nettles for their spring
Kale" ("Rob Roy," c. 7). Gipsies are said to cook it as
an excellent vegetable, and M. Soyer tried hard, but almost
in vain, to recommend it as a most dainty dish. Having so
many uses, we are not surprised to find that it has at times
been regularly cultivated as a garden crop, so that I have
somewhere seen an account of tithe of Nettles being taken;
and in the old churchwardens' account of St. Michael's,
Bath, is the entry in the year 1400, "Pro Urticis venditis ad
Lawrencium Bebbe, 2d."</p>

<p>Nettles are much used in the neighbourhood of London
to pack plums and other fruit with bloom on them, so that
in some market gardens they are not only not destroyed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>[<a href="./images/178.png">178</a>]</span>but encouraged, and even cultivated. And this is an old
practice; Lawson's advice in 1683 was&mdash;"For the gathering
of all other stone-fruit, as Nectarines, Apricots, Peaches,
Pear-plums, Damsons, Bullas, and such like, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the
bottom of your large sives where you put them, you shall lay
Nettles, and likewise in the top, for that will ripen those
that are most unready" ("New Orchard," p. 96).</p>

<p>The "Nettle of India" (No. <a href="#Nettle_5">5</a>) has puzzled the commentators.
It is probably not the true reading; if the true
reading, it may only mean a Nettle of extra-stinging quality;
but it may also mean an Eastern plant that was used to
produce cowage, or cow-itch. "The hairs of the pods of
Mucuna pruriens, &amp;c., constitute the substance called cow-itch,
a mechanical Anthelmintic."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lindley.</span> This plant is
said to have been called the Nettle of India, but I do not
find it so named in Shakespeare's time.</p>

<p>In other points the Nettle is a most interesting plant.
Microscopists find in it most beautiful objects for the microscope;
entomologists value it, for it is such a favourite of
butterflies and other insects, that in Britain alone upwards
of thirty insects feed solely on the Nettle plant, and it is
one of those curious plants which mark the progress of
civilization by following man wherever he goes.<a name="FNanchor_178:1_137" id="FNanchor_178:1_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_178:1_137" class="fnanchor">[178:1]</a></p>

<p>But as a garden plant the only advice to be given is to
keep it out of the garden by every means. In good cultivated
ground it becomes a sad weed if once allowed a
settlement. The Himalayan B&ouml;hmerias, however, are handsome,
but only for their foliage; and though we cannot,
perhaps, admit our roadside Dead Nettles, which however
are much handsomer than many foreign flowers which we
carefully tend and prize, yet the Austrian Dead Nettle
(<i>Lamium orvala</i>, "Bot. Mag.," v. 172) may be well admitted
as a handsome garden plant.</p>

<p>Gerard gives a very fair description of the Nutmeg tree
under the names of Nux moschata or Myristica; but it is
certain that he had not any personal knowledge of the tree,
which was not introduced into England or Europe for nearly
200 years after. Shakespeare could only have known the
imported Nut and the Mace which covers the Nut inside
the shell, and they were imported long before his time.
Chaucer speaks of it as&mdash;</p>

<p>The Nutmeg tree (<i>Myrista officinalis</i>) "is a native of the
Molucca or Spice Islands, principally confined to that group
denominated the Islands of Banda, lying in lat. 4&deg; 30&acute;
south; and there it bears both blossom and fruit at all

Here are several very pleasant pictures, and there is so
much of historical and legendary lore gathered round the
Oaks of England that it is very tempting to dwell upon
them. There are the historical Oaks connected with the
names of William Rufus, Queen Elizabeth, and Charles II.;
there are the wonderful Oaks of Wistman's Wood (certainly
the most weird and most curious wood in England, if not
in Europe); there are the many passages in which our old
English writers have loved to descant on the Oaks of England
as the very emblems of unbroken strength and unflinching
constancy; there is all the national interest which
has linked the glories of the British navy with the steady
and enduring growth of her Oaks; there is the wonderful
picturesqueness of the great Oak plantations of the New
Forest, the Forest of Dean, and other royal forests; and
the equally, if not greater, picturesqueness of the English
Oak as the chief ornament of our great English parks;
there is the scientific interest which suggested the growth of
the Oak for the plan of our lighthouses, and many other
interesting points. It is very tempting to stop on each and
all of these, but the space is too limited, and they can all be
found ably treated of and at full length in any of the books
that have been written on the English forest trees.</p>

There is no certain record by which we can determine
when the Olive tree was first introduced into England.
Miller gives 1648 as the earliest date he could discover, at
which time it was grown in the Oxford Botanic Garden.
But I have no doubt it was cultivated long before that.
Parkinson knew it as an English tree in 1640, for he says:
"It flowereth in the beginning of summer in the warmer
countries, but very late <i>with us</i>; the fruite ripeneth in
autumne in Spain, &amp;c., but seldome <i>with us</i>" ("Herball,"
1640). Gerard had an Oleaster in his garden in 1596, which
Mr. Jackson considers to have been the Olea Europea, and
with good reason, as in his account of the Olive in the
"Herbal" he gives Oleaster as one of the synonyms of
Olea sylvestris, the wild Olive tree. But I think its introduction
is of a still earlier date. In the Anglo-Saxon
"Leech Book," of the tenth century, published under the
direction of the Master of the Rolls, I find this prescription:
"Pound Lovage and Elder rind and Oleaster, that
is, wild Olive tree, mix them with some clear ale and give
to drink" (book i. c. 37, Cockayne's translation). As I
have never heard that the bark of the Olive tree was imported,
it is only reasonable to suppose that the leeches of
the day had access to the living tree. If this be so, the
tree was probably imported by the Romans, which they are
very likely to have done. But it seems very certain that it
was in cultivation in England in Shakespeare's time and he
may have seen it growing.</p>

<p>But in most of the eight passages in which he names the
Olive, the reference to it is mainly as the recognized emblem
of peace; and it is in that aspect, and with thoughts of
its touching Biblical associations that we must always think
of the Olive. It is <i>the</i> special plant of honour in the
Bible, by "whose fatness they honour God and man,"
linked with the rescue of the one family in the ark, and with
the rescue of the whole family of man in the Mount of
Olives. Every passage in which it is named in the Bible tells
the uniform tale of its usefulness, and the emblematical lessons
it was employed to teach; but I must not dwell on them.
Nor need I say how it was equally honoured by Greeks and
Romans. As a plant which produced an abundant and
necessary crop of fruit with little or no labour (<ins class="greek" title="phyteum'">&#966;&#8059;&#964;&#949;&#965;&#956;'</ins>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>[<a href="./images/186.png">186</a>]</span><ins class="greek" title="acheir&ocirc;ton autopoion">&#7936;&#967;&#949;&#8055;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#7936;&#965;&#964;&#8057;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#957;</ins>, Sophocles; "non ulla est oleis cultura,"
Virgil), it was looked upon with special pride, as one of the
most blessed gifts of the gods, and under the constant
protection of Minerva, to whom it was thankfully dedicated.<a name="FNanchor_186:1_138" id="FNanchor_186:1_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_186:1_138" class="fnanchor">[186:1]</a></p>

<p>We seldom see the Olive in English gardens, yet it is a
good evergreen tree to cover a south wall, and having grown
it for many years, I can say that there is no plant&mdash;except,
perhaps, the Christ's Thorn&mdash;which gives such universal
interest to all who see it. It is quite hardy, though the
winter will often destroy the young shoots; but not even
the winter of 1860 did any serious mischief, and fine old
trees may occasionally be seen which attest its hardiness.
There is one at Hanham Hall, near Bristol, which must be
of great age. It is at least 30ft. high, against a south wall,
and has a trunk of large girth; but I never saw it fruit or
flower in England until this year (1877), when the Olive in
my own garden flowered, but did not bear fruit. Miller
records trees at Campden House, Kensington, which, in
1719, produced a good number of fruit large enough for
pickling, and other instances have been recorded lately.
Perhaps if more attention were paid to the grafting, fruit
would follow. The Olive has the curious property that it
seems to be a matter of indifference whether, as with other
fruit, the cultivated sort is grafted on the wild one, or the
wild on the cultivated one; the latter plan was certainly
sometimes the custom among the Greeks and Romans, as
we know from St. Paul (Romans xi. 16-25) and other
writers, and it is sometimes the custom now. There are a
great number of varieties of the cultivated Olive, as of other
cultivated fruit.</p>

<p>One reason why the Olive is not more grown as a garden
tree is that it is a tree very little admired by most travellers.
Yet this is entirely a matter of taste, and some of the
greatest authorities are loud in its praises as a picturesque
tree. One short extract from Ruskin's account of the tree
will suffice, though the whole description is well worth reading.
"The Olive," he says, "is one of the most characteristic
and beautiful features of all southern scenery.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What
the Elm and the Oak are to England, the Olive is to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>[<a href="./images/187.png">187</a>]</span>Italy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It had been well for painters to have felt and
seen the Olive tree, to have loved it for Christ's sake; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to
have loved it even to the hoary dimness of its delicate
foliage, subdued and faint of hue, as if the ashes of the
Gethsemane agony had been cast upon it for ever; and to
have traced line by line the gnarled writhing of its intricate
branches, and the pointed fretwork of its light and narrow
leaves, inlaid on the blue field of the sky, and the small,
rosy-white stars of its spring blossoming, and the heads of
sable fruit scattered by autumn along its topmost boughs&mdash;the
right, in Israel, of the stranger, the fatherless, and the
widow&mdash;and, more than all, the softness of the mantle,
silver-grey, and tender, like the down on a bird's breast,
with which far away it veils the undulation of the mountains."&mdash;<i>Stones
of Venice</i>, vol. iii. p. 176.</p>

<p>There is no need to say much of the Onion in addition to
what I have already said on the Garlick and Leek, except to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>[<a href="./images/188.png">188</a>]</span>note that Onions seem always to have been considered more
refined food than Leek and Garlick. Homer makes Onions
an important part of the elegant little repast which Hecamede
set before Nestor and Machaon&mdash;</p>

<p>But in the time of Shakespeare they were not held in
such esteem. Coghan, writing in 1596, says of them:
"Being eaten raw, they engender all humourous and corruptible
putrifactions in the stomacke, and cause fearful dreames,
and if they be much used they snarre the memory and
trouble the understanding" ("Haven of Health," p. 58).</p>

<p>The name comes directly from the French <i>oignon</i>, a bulb,
being the bulb <i>par excellence</i>, the French name coming from
the Latin <i>unio</i>, which was the name given to some species
of Onion, probably from the bulb growing singly. It may be
noted, however, that the older English name for the Onion
was Ine, of which we may perhaps still have the remembrance
in the common "Inions." The use of the Onion to
promote artificial crying is of very old date, Columella
speaking of "lacrymosa c&aelig;pe," and Pliny of "c&aelig;pis odor
lacrymosus." There are frequent references to the same
use in the old English writers.</p>

<p>The Onion has been for so many centuries in cultivation
that its native home has been much disputed, but it has now
"according to Dr. Regel ('Gartenflora,' 1877, p. 264) been
definitely determined to be the mountains of Central Asia.
It has also been found in a wild state in the Himalaya
Mountains."&mdash;<i>Gardener's Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>I should think it very probable that Shakespeare may
have seen both Orange and Lemon trees growing in England.
The Orange is a native of the East Indies, and no
certain date can be given for its introduction into Europe.
Under the name of the Median Apple a tree is described
first by Theophrastus, and then by Virgil and Palladius,
which is supposed by some to be the Orange; but as they
all describe it as unfit for food, it is with good reason supposed
that the tree referred to is either the Lemon or Citron.
Virgil describes it very exactly&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ipsa ingens arbor, faciemque simillima lauro<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Et si non alium late jactaret odorem<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Laurus erat; folia hand ullis labentia ventis<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Flos ad prima tenax."&mdash;<i>Georgic</i> ii, 131.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Dr. Daubeny, who very carefully studied the plants of
classical writers, decides that the fruit here named is the
Lemon, and says that it "is noticed only as a foreign fruit,
nor does it appear that it was cultivated at that time in
Italy, for Pliny says it will only grow in Media and Assyria,
though Palladius in the fourth century seems to have been
familiar with it, and it was known in Greece at the time of
Theophrastus." But if Oranges were grown in Italy or
Greece in the time of Pliny and Palladius, they did not continue
in cultivation. Europe owes the introduction or reintroduction
to the Portuguese, who brought them from the
East, and they were grown in Spain in the eleventh century.
The first notice of them in Italy was in the year 1200, when
a tree was planted by St. Dominic at Rome. The first
grown in France is said to have been the old tree which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>[<a href="./images/190.png">190</a>]</span>lived at the Orangery at Versailles till November, 1876, and
was called the Grand Bourbon. "In 1421 the Queen of
Navarre gave the gardener the seed from Pampeluna; hence
sprang the plant, which was subsequently transported to
Chantilly. In 1532 the Orange tree was sent to Fontainebleau,
whence, in 1684, Louis XIV. transferred it to Versailles,
where it remained the largest, finest, and most fertile
member of the Orangery, its head being 17yds. round." It
is not likely that a tree of such beauty should be growing so
near England without the English gardeners doing their
utmost to establish it here. But the first certain record is
generally said to be in 1595, when (on the authority of
Bishop Gibson) Orange trees were planted at Beddington,
in Surrey, the plants being raised from seeds brought into
England by Sir Walter Raleigh. The date, however, may
be placed earlier, for in Lyte's "Herbal" (1578) it is stated
that "In this countrie the Herboristes do set and plant the
Orange trees in there gardens, but they beare no fruite
without they be wel kept and defended from cold, and yet
for all that they beare very seldome." There are no Oranges
in Gerard's catalogue of 1596, and though he describes the
trees in his "Herbal," he does not say that he then grew
them or had seen them growing. But by 1599 he had
obtained them, for they occur in his catalogue of that date
under the name of "Malus orantia, the Arange or Orange
tree," so that it is certainly very probable that Shakespeare
may have seen the Orange as a living tree.</p>

<p>As to the beauty of the Orange tree, there is but one
opinion. Andrew Marvel described it as&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">"The Orange bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like golden lamps in a green night."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Bermudas.</i></p>

<p>George Herbert drew a lesson from its power of constant
fruiting&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh that I were an Orenge tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i2i">That busie plant;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Then should I ever laden be,<br /></span>

<p class="authorscpoem">Tennyson.</p>

<p>at once demand the admiration of all. It only fails in one
point to make it a plant for every garden: it is not fully
hardy in England. It is very surprising to read of those
first trees at Beddington, that "they were planted in the
open ground, under a movable covert during the winter
months; that they always bore fruit in great plenty and
perfection; that they grew on the south side of a wall, not
nailed against it, but at full liberty to spread; that they
were 14ft. high, the girth of the stem 29in., and the
spreading of the branches one way 9ft., and 12ft. another;
and that they so lived till they were entirely killed by the
great frost in 1739-40."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Miller.</span><a name="FNanchor_191:1_139" id="FNanchor_191:1_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_191:1_139" class="fnanchor">[191:1]</a> These trees must have
been of a hardy variety, for certainly Orange trees, even
with such protection, do not now so grow in England, except
in a few favoured places on the south coast. There is one
species which is fairly hardy, the Citrus trifoliata, from
Japan,<a name="FNanchor_191:2_140" id="FNanchor_191:2_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_191:2_140" class="fnanchor">[191:2]</a> forming a pretty bush with sweet flowers, and small
but useless fruit (seldom, I believe, produced out-of-doors);
it is often used as a stock on which to graft the better kinds,
but perhaps it might be useful for crossing, so as to give its
hardiness to a variety with better flower and fruit.</p>

<p>Commercially the Orange holds a high place, more than
20,000 good fruit having been picked from one tree, and
England alone importing about 2,000,000 bushels annually.
These are almost entirely used as a dessert fruit and for
marmalade, but it is curious that they do not seem to have
been so used when first imported. Parkinson makes no
mention of their being eaten raw, but says they "are used
as sauce for many sorts of meats, in respect of the sweet
sourness giving a relish and delight whereinsoever they are
used;" and he mentions another curious use, no longer in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>[<a href="./images/192.png">192</a>]</span>fashion, I believe, but which might be worth a trial: "The
seeds being cast into the grounde in the spring time will

<p>The true Oxlip (<i>Primula eliator</i>) is so like both the
Primrose and Cowslip that it has been by many supposed to
be a hybrid between the two. Sir Joseph Hooker, however,
considers it a true species. It is a handsome plant, but it
is probably not the "bold Oxlip" of Shakespeare, or the
plant which is such a favourite in cottage gardens. The
true Oxlip (P. elatior of Jacquin) is an eastern counties'
plant; while the common forms of the Oxlip are hybrids
between the Cowslip and Primrose. (<i>See</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#Cowslip">Cowslip</a></span> and

<p>And from the poem by Shakespeare, published in Chester's
"Love's Martyr," 1601.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Let the bird of loudest lay<br /></span>
<span class="i1i">On the sole Arabian tree<br /></span>
<span class="i1i">Herald sad and Trumpet be,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Two very distinct trees are named in these passages. In
the last five the reference is to the true Palm of Biblical and
classical fame, as the emblem of victory, and the typical
representation of life and beauty in the midst of barren
waste and deserts. And we are not surprised at the veneration
in which the tree was held, when we consider either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>[<a href="./images/194.png">194</a>]</span>the wonderful grace of the tree, or its many uses in its
native countries, so many, that Pliny says that the Orientals
reckoned 360 uses to which the Palm tree could be applied.
Turner, in 1548, said: "I never saw any perfit Date tree
yet, but onely a little one that never came to perfection;"<a name="FNanchor_194:1_143" id="FNanchor_194:1_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_194:1_143" class="fnanchor">[194:1]</a>
and whether Shakespeare ever saw a living Palm tree is doubtful,
but he may have done so. (<i>See</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#Date">Date</a></span>.) Now there are
a great number grown in the large houses of botanic and
other gardens, the Palm-house at Kew showing more and
better specimens than can be seen in any other collection
in Europe: even the open garden can now boast of a few
species that will endure our winters without protection.
Cham&aelig;rops humilis and Fortunei seem to be perfectly
hardy, and good specimens may be seen in several gardens;
Corypha australis is also said to be quite hardy, and there
is little doubt but that the Date Palm (<i>Ph&oelig;nix dactylifera</i>),
which has long been naturalized in the South of Europe,
would live in Devonshire and Cornwall, and that of the
thousand species of Palms growing in so many different
parts of the world, some will yet be found that may grow
well in the open air in England.</p>

<p>But the Palm tree in No. <a href="#Palm_1">1</a> is a totally different tree, and
much as Shakespeare has been laughed at for placing a
Palm tree in the Forest of Arden, the laugh is easily turned
against those who raise such an objection. The Palm tree
of the Forest of Arden is the</p>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Idylls of the King</i>&mdash;Vivien.</p>

<p>that is, the Early Willow (<i>Salix caprea</i>) and I believe it is
so called all over England, as it is in Northern Germany,
and probably in other northern countries. There is little
doubt that the name arose from the custom of using the
Willow branches with the pretty golden catkins on Palm
Sunday as a substitute for Palm branches.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In Rome upon Palm Sunday they bear true Palms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The Cardinals bow reverently and sing old Psalms;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>[<a href="./images/195.png">195</a>]</span>
<span class="i0i">Elsewhere those Psalms are sung 'mid Olive branches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The Holly branch supplies the place among the avalanches;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">More northern climes must be content with the sad Willow."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><span class="smcap">Goethe</span> (quoted by Seeman).</p>

<p>But besides Willow branches, Yew branches are sometimes
used for the same purpose, and so we find Yews called
Palms. Evelyn says they were so called in Kent; they are
still so called in Ireland, and in the churchwarden's accounts
of Woodbury, Devonshire, is the following entry: "Memorandum,
1775. That a Yew or Palm tree was planted in the
churchyard, ye south side of the church, in the same place
where one was blown down by the wind a few days ago,
this 25th of November."<a name="FNanchor_195:1_144" id="FNanchor_195:1_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_195:1_144" class="fnanchor">[195:1]</a></p>

<p>How Willow or Yew branches could ever have been
substituted for such a very different branch as a Palm it is
hard to say, but in lack of a better explanation, I think it
not unlikely that it might have arisen from the direction
for the Feast of Tabernacles in Leviticus xxiii. 40: "Ye
shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees,
the branches of Palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees,
and Willows of the brook." But from whatever cause the
name and the custom was derived, the Willow was so
named in very early times, and in Shakespeare's time
the name was very common. Here is one instance among
many&mdash;</p>

<p>The Pansy is one of the oldest favourites in English
gardens, and the affection for it is shown in the many names
that were given to it. The Anglo-Saxon name was Banwort
or Bonewort, though why such a name was given to it we
cannot now say. Nor can we satisfactorily explain its
common names of Pansy or Pawnce (from the French,
<i>pens&eacute;es</i>&mdash;"that is, for thoughts," says Ophelia), or Heart's-ease,<a name="FNanchor_196:1_145" id="FNanchor_196:1_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_196:1_145" class="fnanchor">[196:1]</a>
which name was originally given to the Wallflower.
The name Cupid's flower seems to be peculiar to Shakespeare,
but the other name, Love-in-idle, or idleness, is said
to be still in use in Warwickshire, and signifies love in vain,
or to no purpose, as in Chaucer: "The prophet David
saith; If God ne kepe not the citee, in ydel waketh he
that keptit it."<a name="FNanchor_196:2_146" id="FNanchor_196:2_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_196:2_146" class="fnanchor">[196:2]</a> And in Tyndale's translation of the New

not bileved ideli" (1 Cor. xv. 2). "Beynge plenteuous in
werk of the Lord evermore, witynge that youre traveil is not
idel in the Lord" (1 Cor. xv. 58).</p>

<p>But beside these more common names, Dr. Prior mentions
the following: "Herb Trinity, Three faces under a hood,
Fancy, Flamy,<a name="FNanchor_197:1_147" id="FNanchor_197:1_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_197:1_147" class="fnanchor">[197:1]</a> Kiss me, Cull me or Cuddle me to you,

Parsley is the abbreviated form of Apium petroselinum,
and is a common name to many umbelliferous plants, but
the garden Parsley is the one meant here. This well-known
little plant has the curious botanic history that no one can
tell what is its native country. In 1548 Turner said, "Perseley
groweth nowhere that I knowe, but only in gardens."<a name="FNanchor_198:1_148" id="FNanchor_198:1_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_198:1_148" class="fnanchor">[198:1]</a> It
is found in many countries, but is always considered an
escape from cultivation. Probably the plant has been so
altered by cultivation as to have lost all likeness to its
original self.</p>

as the leaves&mdash;</p>

<p>The references here are only to the colour of the Peach
blossom, yet the Peach tree was a well-known tree in Shakespeare's
time, and the fruit was esteemed a great delicacy,
and many different varieties were cultivated. Botanically
the Peach is closely allied to the Almond, and still more
closely to the Apricot and Nectarine; indeed, many writers
consider both the Apricot and Nectarine to be only varieties
of the Peach.</p>

<p>The native country of the Peach is now ascertained to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>[<a href="./images/199.png">199</a>]</span>China, and not Persia, as the name would imply. It probably
came to the Romans through Persia, and was by them
introduced into England. It occurs in Archbishop's &AElig;lfric's
"Vocabulary" in the tenth century, "Persicarius, Perseoctreow;"
and John de Garlande grew it in the thirteenth
century, "In virgulto Magistri Johannis, pessicus fert
pessica." It is named in the "Promptorium Parvulorum" as
"Peche, or Peske, frute&mdash;Pesca Pomum Persicum;" and
in a note the Editor says: "In a role of purchases for the
Palace of Westminster preserved amongst the miscellaneous
record of the Queen's remembrance, a payment occurs, Will
le Gardener, pro iij koygnere, ij pichere iij<i>s.</i>&mdash;pro groseillere
iij<i>d</i>, pro j peschere vj<i>d.</i>" <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1275, 4 Edw: 1&mdash;</p>

<p>We all know and appreciate the fruit of the Peach, but
few seem to know how ornamental a tree is the Peach, quite
independent of the fruit. In those parts where the soil and
climate are suitable, the Peach may be grown as an ornamental
spring flowering bush. When so grown preference
is generally given to the double varieties, of which there are
several, and which are not by any means the new plants that
they are generally supposed to be, as they were cultivated
both by Gerard and Parkinson.</p>

<p>If we may judge by these few notices, Shakespeare does
not seem to have had much respect for the Pear, all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>[<a href="./images/200.png">200</a>]</span>references to the fruit being more or less absurd or unpleasant.
Yet there were good Pears in his day, and so
many different kinds that Gerard declined to tell them at
length, for "the stocke or kindred of Pears are not to be
numbered; every country hath his peculiar fruit, so that to
describe them apart were to send an owle to Athens, or to
number those things that are without number."</p>

<p>Of these many sorts Shakespeare mentions by name but
two, the Warden and the Poperin, and it is not possible to
identify these with modern varieties with any certainty. The
Warden was probably a general name for large keeping and
stewing Pears, and the name was said to come from the
Anglo-Saxon <i>wearden</i>, to keep or preserve, in allusion to its
lasting qualities. But this is certainly a mistake. In an
interesting paper by Mr. Hudson Turner, "On the State of
Horticulture in England in early times, chiefly previous to
the fifteenth century," printed in the "Arch&aelig;ological Journal,"
vol. v. p. 301, it is stated that "the Warden Pear had its
origin and its name from the horticultural skill of the
Cistercian Monks of Wardon Abbey in Bedfordshire, founded
in the twelfth century. Three Warden Pears appeared in
the armorial bearings of the Abbey."</p>

<p>It was certainly an early name. In the "Catholicon
Anglicum" we find: "A Parmayn, volemum, Anglice, a
Warden;" and in Parkinson's time the name was still in use,
and he mentions two varieties, "The Warden or Lukewards
Pear are of two sorts, both white and red, both great and
small." (The name of Lukewards seems to point to St.
Luke's Day, October 18, as perhaps the time either for picking
the fruit or for its ripening.) "The Spanish Warden is
greater than either of both the former, and better also."
And he further says: "The Red Warden and the Spanish
Warden are reckoned amongst the most excellent of Pears,
either to bake or to roast, for the sick or for the sound&mdash;and
indeed the Quince and the Warden are the only two fruits
that are permitted to the sick to eat at any time." The
Warden pies of Shakespeare's day, coloured with Saffron,
have in our day been replaced by stewed Pears coloured
with Cochineal.<a name="FNanchor_200:1_149" id="FNanchor_200:1_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_200:1_149" class="fnanchor">[200:1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>[<a href="./images/201.png">201</a>]</span>
I can find no guide to the identification of the Poperin
Pear, beyond Parkinson's description: "The summer Popperin
and the winter Popperin, both of them very good,
firm, dry Pears, somewhat spotted and brownish on the
outside. The green Popperin is a winter fruit of equal
goodnesse with the former." It was probably a Flemish
Pear, and may have been introduced by the antiquary
Leland, who was made Rector of Popering by Henry VIII.
The place is further known to us as mentioned by Chaucer&mdash;</p>

<p>As a garden tree the Pear is not only to be grown for its
fruit, but as a most ornamental tree. Though the individual
flowers are not, perhaps, so handsome as the Apple blossoms,
yet the growth of the tree is far more elegant; and an old
Pear tree, with its curiously roughened bark, its upright, tall,
pyramidal shape, and its sheet of snow-white blossoms, is a
lovely ornament in the old gardens and lawns of many of
our country houses. It is by some considered a British tree,
but it is probably only a naturalized foreigner, originally
introduced by the Romans.</p>

<p>There is no need to say much of Peas, but it may be
worth a note in passing that in old English we seldom meet
with the word Pea. Peas or Pease (the Anglicised form of
Pisum) is the singular, of which the plural is Peason.
"Pisum is called in Englishe a Pease;" says Turner&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>The Child of Bristowe</i>, p. 570.</p>

as by Ben Jonson&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A pill as small as a pease."&mdash;<i>Magnetic Lady.</i><br /></span>

<p>The Squash is the young Pea, before the Peas are formed
in it, and the Peascod is the ripe shell of the Pea before it
is shelled.<a name="FNanchor_202:1_150" id="FNanchor_202:1_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_202:1_150" class="fnanchor">[202:1]</a> The garden Pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) is the cultivated
form of a plant found in the South of Europe, but
very much altered by cultivation. It was probably not
introduced into England as a garden vegetable long before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>[<a href="./images/203.png">203</a>]</span>Shakespeare's time. It is not mentioned in the old lists of
plants before the sixteenth century, and Fuller tells us that
in Queen Elizabeth's time they were brought from Holland,
and were "fit dainties for ladies, they came so far and cost
so dear."</p>

<p>The beautiful ornamental Peas (Sweet Peas, Everlasting
Peas, &amp;c.) are of different family (Lathyrus, not Pisum), but
very closely allied. There is a curious amount of folklore
connected with Peas, and in every case the Peas and
Peascods are connected with wooing the lasses. This explains
Touchstone's speech (No. <a href="#Peas_6">6</a>). Brand gives several
instances of this, from which one stanza from Browne's
"Pastorals" may be quoted&mdash;</p>

<p>Pepper is the seed of Piper nigrum, "whose drupes form
the black Pepper of the shops when dried with the skin upon
them, and white Pepper when that flesh is removed by
washing."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lindley.</span> It is, like all the pepperworts, a
native of the Tropics, but was well known both to the
Greeks and Romans. By the Greeks it was probably not
much used, but in Rome it seems to have been very common,
if we may judge by Horace's lines&mdash;</p>

<p>And in another place he mentions "Pipere albo" as an
ingredient in cooking. Juvenal mentions it as an article of
commerce, "piperis coemti" (Sat. xiv. 293). Persius speaks
of it in more than one passage, and Pliny describes it so
minutely that he evidently not only knew the imported spice,
but also had seen the living plant. By the Romans it was
probably introduced into England, being frequently met with
in the Anglo-Saxon Leech-books. It is mentioned by

arose the familiar reservation of a single peppercorn as a

<p>Pig-nuts or Earth-nuts are the tuberous roots of Conopodium
denudatum (<i>Bunium flexuosum</i>), a common weed in
old upland pastures; it is found also in woods. This root
is really of a pleasant flavour when first eaten, but leaves an
unpleasant taste in the mouth. It is said to be much improved
by roasting, and to be then quite equal to Chestnuts.
Yet it is not much prized in England except by pigs and
children, who do not mind the trouble of digging for it.
But the root lies deep, and the stalk above it is very brittle,
and "when the little 'howker' breaks the white shank he at
once desists from his attempt to reach the root, for he believes
that it will elude his search by sinking deeper and
deeper into the ground" (Johnston). I have never heard
of its being cultivated in England, but it is cultivated in
some European countries, and much prized as a wholesome
and palatable root.</p>

<p>In No. <a href="#Pine_8">8</a> is one of those delicate touches which show
Shakespeare's keen observation of nature, in the effect of the
rising sun upon a group of Pine trees. Mr. Ruskin says
that with the one exception of Wordsworth no other English
poet has noticed this. Wordsworth's lines occur in one of
his minor poems on leaving Italy&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My thoughts become bright like yon edging of Pines<br /></span>
<span class="i1i">On the steep's lofty verge&mdash;how it blackened the air!<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">But touched from behind by the sun, it now shines<br /></span>
<span class="i1i">With threads that seem part of its own silver hair."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>While Mr. Ruskin's account of it is this: "When the sun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>[<a href="./images/207.png">207</a>]</span>rises behind a ridge of Pines, and those Pines are seen from
a distance of a mile or two against his light, the whole form
of the tree, trunk, branches and all, becomes one frost-work
of intensely brilliant silver, which is relieved against the clear
sky like a burning fringe, for some distance on either side of
the sun."&mdash;<i>Stones of Venice</i>, i. 240.</p>

<p>The Pine is the established emblem of everything that is
"high and lifted up," but always with a suggestion of dreariness
and solitude. So it is used by Shakespeare and by
Milton, who always associated the Pine with mountains; and
so it has always been used by the poets, even down to our
own day. Thus Tennyson&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"They came, they cut away my tallest Pines&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">My dark tall Pines, that plumed the craggy ledge&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">High o'er the blue gorge, and all between<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The snowy peak and snow-white cataract<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Fostered the callow eaglet; from beneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Whose thick mysterious boughs in the dark morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The panther's roar came muffled while I sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Down in the valley."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Complaint of &AElig;none.</i></p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott similarly describes the tree in the pretty
and well-known lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Aloft the Ash and warrior Oak<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Cast anchor in the rifted rock;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And higher yet the Pine tree hung<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">His shattered trunk, and frequent flung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Where seemed the cliffs to meet on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">His boughs athwart the narrow sky."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Yet the Pine which was best known to Shakespeare, and
perhaps the only Pine he knew, was the Pinus sylvestris, or
Scotch fir, and this, though flourishing on the highest hills
where nothing else will flourish, certainly attains its fullest
beauty in sheltered lowland districts. There are probably
much finer Scotch firs in Devonshire than can be found in
Scotland. This is the only indigenous Fir, though the Pinus
pinaster claims to be a native of Ireland, some cones having
been supposed to be found in the bogs, but the claim is not
generally allowed (there is no proof of the discovery of
the cones); and yet it has become so completely naturalized
on the coast of Dorsetshire, especially about Bournemouth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>[<a href="./images/208.png">208</a>]</span>that it has been admitted into the last edition of Sowerby's
"English Botany."</p>

<p>But though the Scotch Fir is a true native, and was
probably much more abundant in England formerly than it
is now, the tree has no genuine English name, and apparently
never had. Pine comes directly and without change from
the Latin, <i>Pinus</i>, as one of the chief products, pitch, comes
directly from the Latin, <i>pix</i>. In the early vocabularies it is
called "Pin-treow," and the cones are "Pin-nuttes." They
were also called "Pine apples," and the tree was called the
Pine-Apple Tree.<a name="FNanchor_208:1_152" id="FNanchor_208:1_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_208:1_152" class="fnanchor">[208:1]</a> This name was transferred to the rich
West Indian fruit<a name="FNanchor_208:2_153" id="FNanchor_208:2_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_208:2_153" class="fnanchor">[208:2]</a> from its similarity to a fir-cone, and so was
lost to the fruit of the fir-tree, which had to borrow a new
name from the Greek; but it was still in use in Shakespeare's
day&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sweete smelling Firre that frankensence provokes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And Pine Apples from whence sweet juyce doth come."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><span class="smcap">Chester's</span> <i>Love's Martyr</i>.</p>

<p>And Gerard describing the fruit of the Pine Tree, says:
"This Apple is called in .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Low Dutch, Pyn Appel, and
in English, Pine-apple, clog, and cones." We also find
"Fyre-tree," which is a true English word meaning the "fire-tree;"
but I believe that "Fir" was originally confined to
the timber, from its large use for torches, and was not till
later years applied to the living tree.</p>

<p>The sweetness of the Pine seeds, joined to the difficulty
of extracting them, and the length of time necessary for their
ripening, did not escape the notice of the emblem-writers of
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. With them it was
the favourite emblem of the happy results of persevering
labour. Camerarius, a contemporary of Shakespeare and a
great botanist, gives a pretty plate of a man holding a Fir-cone,
with this moral: "Sic ad virtutem et honestatem et
laudabiles actiones non nisi per labores ac varias difficultates
perveniri potest, at postea sequuntur suavissimi fructus."
He acknowledges his obligation for this moral to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>[<a href="./images/209.png">209</a>]</span>proverb of Plautus: "Qui e nuce nucleum esse vult, frangat
nucem" ("Symbolorum," &amp;c., 1590).</p>

<p>In Shakespeare's time a few of the European Conifers
were grown in England, including the Larch, but only as
curiosities. The very large number of species which now
ornament our gardens and Pineta from America and Japan
were quite unknown. The many uses of the Pine&mdash;for its
timber, production of pitch, tar, resin, and turpentine&mdash;were
well known and valued. Shakespeare mentions both pitch
and tar.</p>

<p>To these may perhaps be added the following, from the

<p>The authority is doubtful, but it is attributed to Shakespeare
in some editions of his poems.</p>

<p>The Pink or Pincke was, as now, the name of the smaller
sorts of Carnations, and was generally applied to the single
sorts. It must have been a very favourite flower, as we may
gather from the phrase "Pink of courtesy," which means
courtesy carried to its highest point; and from Spenser's
pretty comparison&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>[<a href="./images/210.png">210</a>]</span>
The name has a curious history. It is not, as most of us
would suppose, derived from the colour, but the colour gets
its name from the plant. The name (according to Dr. Prior)
comes through <i>Pinksten</i> (German), from Pentecost, and so
was originally applied to one species&mdash;the Whitsuntide Gilliflower.
From this it was applied to other species of the
same family. It is certainly "a curious accident," as Dr.
Prior observes, "that a word that originally meant 'fiftieth'
should come to be successively the name of a festival of the
Church, of a flower, of an ornament in muslin called <i>pinking</i>,
of a colour, and of a sword stab." Shakespeare uses
the word in three of its senses. First, as applied to a
colour&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come, thou monarch of the Vine,<br /></span>

<p>Second, as applied to an ornament of dress in Romeo's
person&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then is my pump well flowered;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, act ii, sc. 4.</p>

<p><i>i.e.</i>, well pinked. And in Grumio's excuses to Petruchio for
the non-attendance of the servants&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nathaniel's coat, Sir, was not fully made,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Taming of the Shrew</i>, act iv, sc. 1.</p>

<p>And thirdly, as the pinked ornament in muslin&mdash;</p>

<p>There is much dispute about this passage, the dispute
turning on the question whether "Pioned" has reference to
the Peony flower or not. The word by some is supposed to
mean only "digged," and it doubtless often had this meaning,<a name="FNanchor_211:1_155" id="FNanchor_211:1_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_211:1_155" class="fnanchor">[211:1]</a>
though the word is now obsolete, and only survives
with us in "pioneer," which, in Shakespeare's time, meant
"digger" only, and not as now, "one who goes before to
prepare the way"&mdash;thus Hamlet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well said, old mole! cans't work i' the earth so fast?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A worthy pioner?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Hamlet</i>, act i, sc. 5 (161).</p>

<p>and again&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There might you see the labouring pioner<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begrim'd with sweat, and smeared all with dust.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Lucrece</i> (1380).</p>

<p>But this reading seems very tame, tame in itself, and doubly
tame when taken in connection with the context, and "Certainly
savours more of the commentators' prose than of
Shakespeare's poetry" ("Edinburgh Review," 1872, p. 363).
I shall assume, therefore, that the flower is meant, spelt in
the form of "Piony," instead of Peony or P&aelig;ony.<a name="FNanchor_211:2_156" id="FNanchor_211:2_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_211:2_156" class="fnanchor">[211:2]</a></p>

<p>The P&aelig;ony (<i>P. corallina</i>) is sometimes allowed a place in
the British flora, having been found apparently wild at the
Steep Holmes in the Bristol Channel and a few other places,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>[<a href="./images/212.png">212</a>]</span>but it is now considered certain that in all these places it is
a garden escape. Gerard gave one such habitat: "The
male Peionie groweth wilde upon a Coneyberry in Betsome,
being in the parish of Southfleet, in Kent, two miles from
Gravesend, and in the ground sometimes belonging to a
farmer there, called John Bradley;" but on this his editor
adds the damaging note: "I have been told that our author
himselfe planted that Peionee there, and afterwards seemed
to find it there by accident; and I do believe it was so, because
none before or since have ever seen or heard of it
growing wild since in any part of this kingdome."</p>

<p>But though not a native plant, it had been cultivated in
England long before Shakespeare's and Gerard's time. It
occurs in most of the old vocabularies from the tenth century
downwards, and in Shakespeare's time the English
gardens had most of the European species that are now
grown, including also the handsome double-red and white
varieties. Since his time the number of species and varieties
has been largely increased by the addition of the Chinese and
Japanese species, and by the labours of the French nurserymen,
who have paid more attention to the flower than the
English.</p>

<p>In the hardy flower garden there is no more showy family
than the P&aelig;ony. They have flowers of many colours, from
almost pure white and pale yellow to the richest crimson;
and they vary very much in their foliage, most of them
having large fleshy leaves, "not much unlike the leaves of
the Walnut tree," but some of them having their leaves
finely cut and divided almost like the leaves of Fennel (<i>P.
tenuifolia</i>). They further vary in that some are herbaceous,
disappearing entirely in winter, while others, Moutan or
Tree P&aelig;onies, are shrubs; and in favourable seasons, when
the shrub is not injured by spring frosts, there is no grander
shrub than an old Tree P&aelig;ony in full flower.</p>

<p>Of the many different species the best are the Moutans,
which, according to Chinese tradition, have been grown in
China for 1500 years, and which are now produced in great
variety of colour; P. corallina, for the beauty of its coral-like
seeds; P. Cretica, for its earliness in flowering; P.
tenuifolia, single and double, for its elegant foliage; P.
Whitmaniana, for its pale yellow but very fleeting flowers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>[<a href="./images/213.png">213</a>]</span>which, before they are fully expanded, have all the appearance
of immense Globe-flowers (<i>trollius</i>); P. lobata, for the
wonderful richness of its bright crimson flowers; and P.
Whitleji, a very old and very double form of P. edulis, of
great size, and most delicate pink and white colour.</p>

<p>There is no certain record how long the Plane has been
introduced into England; it is certainly not a native tree,
nor even an European tree, but came from the East, and
was largely planted and much admired both by the Greeks
and Romans. We know from Pliny that it was growing in
France in his day on the part opposite Britain, and the
name occurs in the old vocabularies. But from Turner's
evidence in 1548 it must have been a very scarce tree
in the sixteenth century. He says: "I never saw any Plaine
tree in Englande, saving once in Northumberlande besyde
Morpeth, and an other at Barnwell Abbey besyde Cambryge."
And more than a hundred years later Evelyn records a
special visit to Lee to inspect one as a great curiosity. The
Plane is not only a very handsome tree, and a fast grower,
but from the fact that it yearly sheds its bark it has become
one of the most useful trees for growing in towns. The
wood is of very little value. To the emblem writers the
Plane was an example of something good to the eye, but of
no real use. Camerarius so moralizes it (Pl. xix.), and,
quoting Virgil's "steriles platanos," he says of it, "umbram
non fructum platanus dat."</p>

<p>The most common old names for the Plantain were Waybroad
(corrupted to Weybread, Wayborn, and Wayforn)
and Ribwort. It was also called Lamb's-tongue and
Kemps, while the flower spike with the stalk was called
Cocks and Cockfighters (still so called by children).<a name="FNanchor_214:1_157" id="FNanchor_214:1_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_214:1_157" class="fnanchor">[214:1]</a> The
old name of Ribwort was derived from the ribbed leaves,
while Waybroad marked its universal appearance, scattered
by all roadsides and pathways, and literally bred by the
wayside. It has a similar name in German, Wegetritt, that
is Waytread; and on this account the Swedes name the
plant Wagbredblad, and the Indians of North America
Whiteman's Foot, for it springs up near every new settlement,
having sprung up after the English settlers, not only
in America, but also in Australia and New Zealand&mdash;</p>

<p>And "so it is a mistake to say that Plantain is derived from
the likeness of the plant to the sole of the foot, as in
Richardson's Dictionary. Rather say, because the herb
grows under the sole of the foot."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Johnston.</span> How, or
when, or why the plant lost its old English names to take
the Latin name of Plantain, it is hard to say. It occurs in
a vocabulary of the names of plants of the middle of the
thirteenth century&mdash;"Plantago, Planteine, Weibrode," and
apparently came to us from the French, "Cy est assets de
Planteyne, Weybrede."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Walter de Biblesworth</span> (13th
cent.) But with the exception of Chaucer<a name="FNanchor_215:1_158" id="FNanchor_215:1_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_215:1_158" class="fnanchor">[215:1]</a> I believe
Shakespeare is almost the only early writer that uses the
name, though it is very certain that he did not invent it;
but "Plantage" (No <a href="#Plantain_3">3</a>), which is doubtless the same plant,
is peculiar to him.<a name="FNanchor_215:2_159" id="FNanchor_215:2_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_215:2_159" class="fnanchor">[215:2]</a></p>

<p>It was as a medical herb that our forefathers chiefly valued
the Plantain, and for medical purposes its reputation was of
the very highest. In a book of recipes (Lacnunga) of the
eleventh century, by &AElig;lfric, is an address to the Waybroad,
which is worth extracting at length&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And thou, Waybroad!<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Mother of worts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Open from eastward,<br /></span>

<span class="i0i">Venom and vile things<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And all the loathly ones<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">That through the land rove."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><span class="smcap">Cockayne's</span> <i>Translation</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>[<a href="./images/216.png">216</a>]</span>
In another earlier recipe book the Waybroad is prescribed
for twenty-two diseases, one after another; and in another
of the same date we are taught how to apply it: "If a man
ache in half his head .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. delve up Waybroad without iron
ere the rising of the sun, bind the roots about the head with
Crosswort by a red fillet, soon he will be well." But the
Plantain did not long sustain its high reputation, which even
in Shakespeare's time had become much diminished. "I
find," says Gerard, "in ancient writers many good-morrowes,
which I think not meet to bring into your memorie againe;
as that three roots will cure one griefe, four another disease,
six hanged about the neck are good for another maladie,
&amp;c., all which are but ridiculous toys." Yet the bruised
leaves still have some reputation as a styptic and healing
plaster among country herbalists, and perhaps the alleged
virtues are not altogether fanciful.</p>

<p>As a garden plant the Plantain can only be regarded as a
weed and nuisance, especially on lawns, where it is very
difficult to destroy them. Yet there are some curious
varieties which may claim a corner where botanical curiosities
are grown. The Plantain seems to have a peculiar
tendency to run into abnormal forms, many of which will
be found described and figured in Dr. Masters' "Vegetable
Teratology," and among these forms are two which are
exactly like a double green Rose, and have been cultivated
as the Rose Plantain for many years. They were grown by
Gerard, who speaks of "the beauty which is in the plant,"
and compared it to "a fine double Rose of a hoary or rusty
greene colour." Parkinson also grew it and valued it
highly.</p>

<p>Plums, Damsons, and Prunes may conveniently be joined
together, Plums and Damsons being often used synonymously
(as in No. <a href="#Plum_3">3</a>), and Prunes being the dried Plums.
The Damsons were originally, no doubt, a good variety from
the East, and nominally from Damascus.<a name="FNanchor_217:2_161" id="FNanchor_217:2_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_217:2_161" class="fnanchor">[217:2]</a> They seem to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>[<a href="./images/218.png">218</a>]</span>have been considered great delicacies, as in a curious allegorical
drama of the fifteenth century, called "La Nef de
Sante," of which an account is given by Mr. Wright:
"Bonne-Compagnie, to begin the day, orders a collation, at
which, among other things, are served Damsons (<i>Prunes
de Damas</i>), which appear at this time to have been considered
as delicacies. There is here a marginal direction to
the purport that if the morality should be performed in the
season when real Damsons could not be had, the performers
must have some made of wax to look like real ones" ("History
of Domestic Manners," &amp;c.).</p>

<p>The garden Plums are a good cultivated variety of our
own wild Sloe, but a variety that did not originate in England,
and may very probably have been introduced by the
Romans. The Sloe and Bullace are, speaking botanically,
two sub-species of Prunus communis, while the Plum is a
third sub-species (P. communis domestica). The garden
Plum is occasionally found wild in England, but is certainly
not indigenous. It is somewhat strange that our wild plant
is not mentioned by Shakespeare under any of its well-known
names of Sloe, Bullace, and Blackthorn. Not only
is it a shrub of very marked appearance in our hedgerows
in early spring, when it is covered with its pure white blossoms,
but Blackthorn staves were indispensable in the rough
game of quarterstaff, and the Sloe gave point to more than
one English proverb: "as black as a Sloe," was a very
common comparison, and "as useless as a Sloe," or "not
worth a Sloe," was as common.</p>

<p>As soon as the garden Plum was introduced, great attention
seems to have been paid to it, and the gardeners of
Shakespeare's time could probably show as good Plums as
we can now. "To write of Plums particularly," said
Gerard, "would require a peculiar volume.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Every
clymate hath his owne fruite, far different from that of other
countries; my selfe have threescore sorts in my garden, and
all strange and rare; there be in other places many more
common, and yet yearly commeth to our hands others not
before knowne."</p>

<p>There are few trees that surpass the Pomegranate in interest
and beauty combined. "Whoever has seen the Pomegranate
in a favourable soil and climate, whether as a single
shrub or grouped many together, has seen one of the most
beautiful of green trees; its spiry shape and thick-tufted
foliage of vigorous green, each growing shoot shaded into
tenderer verdure and bordered with crimson and adorned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>[<a href="./images/220.png">220</a>]</span>with the loveliest flowers; filmy petals of scarlet lustre are
put forth from the solid crimson cup, and the ripe fruit of
richest hue and most admirable shape."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lady Calcott's</span>
<i>Scripture Herbal</i>. A simpler but more valued testimony to
the beauty of the Pomegranate is borne in its selection for
the choicest ornaments on the ark of the Tabernacle, on
the priest's vestments, and on the rich capitals of the pillars
in the Temple of Solomon.</p>

<p>The native home of the Pomegranate is not very certainly
known, but the evidence chiefly points to the North
of Africa. It was very early cultivated in Egypt, and was
one of the Egyptian delicacies so fondly remembered by the
Israelites in their desert wanderings, and is frequently met
with in Egyptian sculpture. It was abundant in Palestine,
and is often mentioned in the Bible, and always as an
object of beauty and desire. It was highly appreciated by
the Greeks and Romans, but it was probably not introduced
into Italy in very early times, as Pliny is the first author
that certainly mentions it, though some critics have supposed
that the <i>aurea mala</i> and <i>aurea poma</i> of Virgil and Ovid
were Pomegranates. From Italy the tree soon spread into
other parts of Europe, taking with it its Roman name of
<i>Punica malus</i> or <i>Pomum granatum</i>. <i>Punica</i> showed the
country from which the Romans derived it, while <i>granatum</i>
(full of grains) marked the special characteristic of the
fruit that distinguished it from all other so-called Apples.
Gerard says: "Pomegranates grow in hot countries,
towards the south in Italy, Spaine, and chiefly in the kingdom
of Granada, which is thought to be so named of the
great multitude of Pomegranates, which be commonly called
<i>Granata</i>."<a name="FNanchor_220:1_163" id="FNanchor_220:1_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_220:1_163" class="fnanchor">[220:1]</a> This derivation is very doubtful, but was commonly

and flowers well in England, but when it was first introduced
is not recorded. I do not find it in the old vocabularies,
but a prominent place is given to it in "that

<p>Turner describes it in 1548: "Pomegranat trees growe
plentuously in Italy and in Spayne, and there are certayne
in my Lorde's gardene at Syon, but their fruite cometh
never with perfection."<a name="FNanchor_221:1_165" id="FNanchor_221:1_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_221:1_165" class="fnanchor">[221:1]</a></p>

<p>Gerard had it in 1596, but from his description it seems
that it was a recent acquisition. "I have recovered," he
says, "divers young trees hereof, by sowing of the seed or
grains of the height of three or four cubits, attending God's
leisure for floures and fruit." Three years later, in 1599, it
is noticed for its flowers in Buttes's "Dyet's Dry Dinner" (as
quoted by Brand), where it is asserted that "if one eate
three small Pomegranate flowers (they say) for a whole yeare
he shall be safe from all manner of eyesore;" and Gerard
speaks of the "wine which is pressed forth of the Pomegranate
berries named Rhoitas or wine of Pomegranates,"
but this may have been imported. But, when introduced, it
at once took kindly to its new home, so that Parkinson was
able to describe its flowers and fruits from personal observation.
In all the southern parts of England it grows very
well, and is one of the very best trees we have to cover a
south wall; it also grows well in towns, as may be seen at
Bath, where a great many very fine specimens have been
planted in the areas in front of the houses, and have grown
to a considerable height. When thus planted and properly
pruned, the tree will bear its beautiful flowers from May all
through the summer; but generally the tree is so pruned
that it cannot flower. It should be pruned like a Banksian
Rose, and other plants that bear their flowers on last year's
shoots, <i>i.e.</i>, simply thinned, but not cut back or spurred.
With this treatment the branches may be allowed to grow
in their natural way without being nailed in, and if the
single-blossomed species be grown, the flowers in good
summers will bear fruit. In 1876 I counted on a tree in
Bath more than sixty fruit; the fruits will perhaps seldom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>[<a href="./images/222.png">222</a>]</span>be worth eating, but they are curious and handsome. The
sorts usually grown are the pure scarlet (double and single),
and a very double variety with the flowers somewhat variegated.
These are the most desirable, but there are a few
other species and varieties, including a very beautiful dwarf
one from the East Indies that is too tender for our climate
out-of-doors, but is largely grown on the Continent as a
window plant.</p>

<p>The Poppy had of old a few other names, such as Corn-rose
and Cheese-bowls (a very old name for the flower), and
being "of great beautie, although of evil smell, our gentlewomen
doe call it Jone Silverpin." This name is difficult
of explanation, even with Parkinson's help, who says it
meanes "faire without and foule within," but it probably
alludes to its gaudy colour and worthlessness. But these
names are scarcely the common names of the plant, but rather
nicknames; the usual name is, and always has been, Poppy,
which is an easily traced corruption from the Latin <i>papaver</i>,
the Saxon and Early English names being variously spelt,
<i>popig</i> and <i>papig</i>, <i>popi</i> and <i>papy</i>; so that the Poppy is another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>[<a href="./images/223.png">223</a>]</span>instance of a very common and conspicuous English plant
known only or chiefly by its Latin name Anglicised.</p>

<p>Our common English Poppy, "being of a beautiful and
gallant red colour," is certainly one of the handsomest of
our wild flowers, and a Wheat field with a rich undergrowth
of scarlet Poppies is a sight very dear to the artist,<a name="FNanchor_223:1_166" id="FNanchor_223:1_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_223:1_166" class="fnanchor">[223:1]</a> while
the weed is not supposed to do much harm to the farmer.
But this is not the Poppy mentioned by Iago, for its narcotic
qualities are very small; the Poppy that he alludes to
is the Opium Poppy (<i>P. somniferum</i>). This Poppy was well
known and cultivated in England long before Shakespeare's
day, but only as a garden ornament; the Opium was then,
as now, imported from the East. Its deadly qualities were
well known. Gower describes it&mdash;</p>

<p>Many of the Poppies are very ornamental garden plants.
The pretty yellow Welsh Poppy (<i>Meconopsis Cambrica</i>), abundant
at Cheddar Cliffs, is an excellent plant for the rockwork
where, when once established, it will grow freely and
sow itself; and for the same place the little Papaver Alpinum,
with its varieties, is equally well suited. For the
open border the larger Poppies are very suitable, especially
the great Oriental Poppy (<i>P. orientale</i>) and the grand
scarlet Siberian Poppy (<i>P. bracteatum</i>), perhaps the most
gorgeous of hardy plants: while among the rarer species of
the tribe we must reckon the Meconopses of the Himalayas
(<i>M. Wallichi</i> and <i>M. Nepalensis</i>), plants of singular beauty
and elegance, but very difficult to grow, and still more difficult
to keep, even if once established; for though perfectly
hardy, they are little more than biennials. Besides these
Poppies, the large double garden Poppies are very showy
and of great variety in colour, but they are only annuals.</p>

<p>The chief interest in these two passages is that they
contain almost the earliest notice of Potatoes after their
introduction into England. The generally received account
is that they were introduced into Ireland in 1584 by Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>[<a href="./images/225.png">225</a>]</span>Walter Raleigh, and from thence brought into England;
but the year of their first planting in England is not
recorded. They are not mentioned by Lyte in 1586.
Gerard grew them in 1597, but only as curiosities, under
the name of Virginian Potatoes (<i>Battata Virginianorum</i> and
<i>Pappas</i>), to distinguish them from the Spanish Potato, or
Convolvulus Battatas, which had been long grown in
Europe, and in the first edition of his "Herbal" is his
portrait, showing him holding a Potato in his hand. They
seem to have grown into favour very slowly, for half a century
after their introduction, Waller still spoke of them as
one of the tropical luxuries of the Bermudas&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>The Battel of the Summer Islands.</i></p>

<p>Potato is a corruption of Batatas or Patatas.</p>

<p>As soon as the Potato arrived in England, it was at once
invested with wonderful restorative powers, and in a long
exhaustive note in Steevens' Shakespeare, Mr. Collins has
given all the passages in the early writers in which the
Potato is mentioned, and in every case they have reference
to these supposed virtues. These passages, which are
chiefly from the old dramatists, are curious and interesting
in the early history of the Potato, and as throwing light on
the manners of our ancestors; but as in every instance they
are all more or less indelicate, I refrain from quoting them
here.</p>

<p>As a garden plant, we now restrict the Potato to the
kitchen garden and the field, but it belongs to a very large
family, the Solanace&aelig; or Nightshades, of which many members
are very ornamental, though as they chiefly come from
the tropical regions, there are very few that can be treated
as entirely hardy plants. One, however, is a very beautiful
climber&mdash;the Solanum jasminoides from South America&mdash;and
quite hardy in the South of England. Trained against
a wall it will soon cover it, and when once established will
bear its handsome trusses of white flowers with yellow
anthers in great profusion during the whole summer. A
better known member of the family is the Petunia, very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>[<a href="./images/226.png">226</a>]</span>handsome, but little better than an annual. The pretty
Winter Cherry (<i>Physalis alkekengi</i>) is another member of
the family, and so is the Mandrake (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#Mandrake">Mandrake</a></span>). The
whole tribe is poisonous, or at least to be suspected, yet it
contains a large number of most useful plants, as the Potato,
Tomato, Tobacco, Datura, and Cayenne Pepper.</p>

<p>It is the first flower, except perhaps the Daisy, of which a
child learns the familiar name; and yet it is a plant of unfailing
interest to the botanical student, while its name is
one of the greatest puzzles to the etymologist. The common
and easy explanation of the name is that it means the first
Rose of the year, but (like so many explanations that are
derived only from the sound and modern appearance of a
a name) this is not the true account. The full history of
the name is too long to give here, but the short account is
this&mdash;"The old name was Prime Rolles&mdash;or primerole.
Primerole is an abbreviation of Fr., <i>primeverole</i>: It., <i>primaverola</i>,
diminutive of <i>prima vera</i> from <i>flor di prima vera</i>, the
first spring flower. <i>Primerole</i>, as an outlandish unintelligible
word, was soon familiarized into <i>primerolles</i>, and this into
<i>primrose</i>."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. Prior.</span> The name Primrose was not at
first always applied to the flower, but was an old English
word, used to show excellence&mdash;</p>

<p>It was also a flower name, but not of our present Primrose,
but of a very different plant. Thus in a Nominale of the
fifteenth century we have "hoc ligustrum, a Primerose;" and
in a Pictorial Vocabulary of the same date we have "hoc
ligustrum, A<sup>ce</sup> a Prymrose;" and in the "Promptorium
Parvulorum," "Prymerose, primula, calendula, ligustrum"&mdash;and
this name for the Privet lasted with a slight alteration
into Shakespeare's time. Turner in 1538 says, "ligustrum
arbor est non herba ut literator&#363; vulgus credit; nihil que
minus est quam a Prymerose." In Tusser's "Husbandry"
we have "set Privie or Prim" (September Abstract), and&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now set ye may<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The Box and Bay<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Hawthorn and Prim<br /></span>
<span class="i1i">For clothe's trim"&mdash;(<i>January Abstract</i>).<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And so it is described by Gerard as the Privet or Prim Print
(<i>i.e.</i>, <i>prim&eacute; printemps</i>), and even in the seventeenth century,
Cole says of ligustrum, "This herbe is called Primrose."
When the name was fixed to our present plant I cannot say,
but certainly before Shakespeare's time, though probably not
long before. It is rather remarkable that the flower, which
we now so much admire, seems to have been very much
overlooked by the writers before Shakespeare. In the very
old vocabularies it does not at all appear by its present
Latin name, Primula vulgaris, but that is perhaps not to be
wondered at, as nearly all the old botanists applied that
name to the Daisy. But neither is it much noticed by any
English name. I can only find it in two of the vocabularies.
In an English Vocabulary of the fourteenth century is "H&aelig;c
pimpinella, A<sup>e</sup> primerolle," but it is very doubtful if this can
be our Primrose, as the Pimpernel of old writers was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>[<a href="./images/229.png">229</a>]</span>Burnet. Gower mentions it as the flower of the star Canis
Minor&mdash;</p>

<p>I have dwelt longer than usual on the name of this flower,
because it gives us an excellent example of how much literary
interest may be found even in the names of our common
English plants.</p>

<p>But it is time to come from the name to the flower. The
English Primrose is one of a large family of more than fifty
species, represented in England by the Primrose, the Oxlip,
the Cowslip, and the Bird's-eye Primrose of the North of
England and Scotland. All the members of the family,
whether British or exotic, are noted for the simple beauty of
their flowers, but in this special character there is none that
surpasses our own. "It is the very flower of delicacy and
refinement; not that it shrinks from our notice, for few
plants are more easily seen, coming as it does when there is
a dearth of flowers, when the first birds are singing, and the
first bees humming, and the earliest green putting forth in
the March and April woods; and it is one of those plants
which dislikes to be looking cheerless, but keeps up a
smouldering fire of blossom from the very opening of the
year, if the weather will permit."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Forbes Watson.</span> It is
this character of cheerfulness that so much endears the
flower to us; as it brightens up our hedgerows after the
dulness of winter, the harbinger of many brighter perhaps,
but not more acceptable, beauties to come, it is the very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>[<a href="./images/230.png">230</a>]</span>emblem of cheerfulness. Yet it is very curious to note what
entirely different ideas it suggested to our forefathers. To
them the Primrose seems always to have brought associations
of sadness, or even worse than sadness, for the "Primrose
paths" and "Primrose ways" of Nos. <a href="#Primrose_6">6</a> and <a href="#Primrose_7">7</a> are meant
to be suggestive of pleasures, but sinful pleasures.</p>

<p>Spenser associates it with death in some beautiful lines, in
which a husband laments the loss of a young and beautiful
wife&mdash;</p>

he speaks of youth as "Brisk as the April buds in Primrose

speak of the Primrose itself, and in two of these he connects
it with death&mdash;</p>

<p>I can only refer very shortly to the botanical interest of
the Primula, and that only to direct attention to Mr. Darwin's
paper in the "Journal of the Linn&aelig;an Society," 1862, in which
he records his very curious and painstaking inquiries into
the dimorphism of the Primula, a peculiarity in the Primula
that gardeners had long recognized in their arrangement of
Primroses as "pin-eyed" and "thrum-eyed." It is perhaps
owing to this dimorphism that the family is able to show a
very large number of natural hybrids. These have been
carefully studied by Professor Kerner, of Innspruck, and it
seems not unlikely that a further study will show that all the
European so-called species are natural hybrids from a very
few parents.</p>

<p>Yet a few words on the Primrose as a garden plant. If
the Primrose be taken from the hedges in November, and
planted in beds thickly in the garden, they make a beautiful
display of flowers and foliage from February till the beds
are required for the summer flowers; and there are few of
our wild flowers that run into so many varieties in their wild
state. In Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire I have seen the
wild Primrose of nearly all shades of colour, from the purest
white to an almost bright red, and these can all be brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>[<a href="./images/232.png">232</a>]</span>into the garden with a certainty of success and a certainty
of rapid increase. There are also many double varieties, all
of which are more often seen in cottage gardens than elsewhere;
yet no gardener need despise them.</p>

<p>One other British Primrose, the Bird's-eye Primrose,
almost defies garden cultivation, though in its native habitats
in the north it grows in most ungenial places. I have seen
places in the neighbourhood of the bleak hill of Ingleborough,
where it almost forms the turf; yet away from its
native habitat it is difficult to keep, except in a greenhouse.
For the cultivation of the other non-English species, I
cannot do better than refer to an excellent paper by Mr.
Niven in the "The Garden" for January 29, 1876, in which
he gives an exhaustive account of them.</p>

<p>I am not aware that Primroses are of any use in medicine
or cookery, yet Tusser names the Primrose among "seeds
and herbs for the kitchen," and Lyte says "the Cowslips,
Primroses, and Oxlips are now used dayly amongst other
pot herbes, but in physicke there is no great account made
of them." They occur in heraldy. The arms of the Earls
of Rosebery (Primrose) are three Primroses within a double
tressure fleury counter-fleury, or.</p>

<p>The old name for the Cucumber (in &AElig;lfric's "Vocabulary")
is hwer-hwette, <i>i.e.</i>, wet ewer, but Pumpion, Pompion, and
Pumpkin were general terms including all the Cucurbitace&aelig;
such as Melons, Gourds, Cucumbers, and Vegetable Marrows.
All were largely grown in Shakespeare's days, but I should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>[<a href="./images/233.png">233</a>]</span>think the reference here must be to one of the large useless
Gourds, for Mrs. Ford's comparison is to Falstaff, and
Gourds were grown large enough to bear out even that
comparison. "The Gourd groweth into any forme or
fashion you would have it, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. being suffered to clime
upon an arbour where the fruit may hang; it hath beene
seene to be nine foot long." And the little value placed
upon the whole tribe helped to bear out the comparison.
They were chiefly good to "cure copper faces, red and
shining fierce noses (as red as red Roses), with pimples,
pumples, rubies, and such-like precious faces." This was
Gerard's account of the Cucumber, while of the Cucumber
Pompion, which was evidently our Vegetable Marrow, and
of which he has described and figured the variety which
we now call the Custard Marrow, he says, "it maketh a
man apt and ready to fall into the disease called the
colericke passion, and of some the felonie."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ford's comparison of a big loutish man to an overgrown
Gourd has not been lost in the English language, for
"bumpkin" is only another form of "Pumpkin," and Mr.
Fox Talbot, in his "English Etymologies," has a very
curious account of the antiquity of the nickname. "The
Greeks," he says, "called a very weak and soft-headed
person a Pumpion, whence the proverb <ins class="greek" title="peponos malak&ocirc;teros">&#960;&#949;&#960;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#956;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#954;&#969;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962;</ins>,
softer than a Pumpion; and even one of Homer's heroes,
incensed at the timidity of his soldiers, exclaims <ins class="greek" title="&ocirc; pepones">&#8032; &#960;&#949;&#960;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#962;</ins>,
you Pumpions! So also <i>cornichon</i> (Cucumber) is a term of
derision in French."</p>

<p>Yet the Pumpion or Gourd had its uses, moral uses.
Modern critics have decided that Jonah's Gourd, "which
came up in a night and perished in a night," was not a
Gourd, but the Palma Christi, or Castor-oil tree. But our
forefathers called it a Gourd, and believing that it was so,
they used the Gourd to point many a moral and illustrate
many a religious emblem. Thus viewed it was the standing
emblem of the rapid growth and quick decay of evil-doers
and their evil deeds. "Cito nata, cito pereunt," was the
history of the evil deeds, while the doers of them could only
say&mdash;</p>

<p>Quince is also the name of one of the "homespun actors"
in "Midsummer Night's Dream," and is no doubt there used
as a ludicrous name. The name was anciently spelt "coynes"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And many homely trees ther were<br /></span>

<span class="i0i">Cherys, of which many oon fayne is."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Romaunt of the Rose.</i></p>

<p>The same name occurs in the old English vocabularies, as
in a Nominale of the fifteenth century, "h&aelig;c cocianus, a
coventre;" in an English vocabulary of the fourteenth
century, "Hoc coccinum, a quoyne," and in the treatise of
Walter de Biblesworth, in the thirteenth century&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Issi troverez en ce verger<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Estang un sek Coigner (a Coyn-tre, Quince-tre)."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And there is little doubt that "Quince" is a corruption of
"coynes" which again is a corruption, not difficult to trace,
of Cydonia, one of the most ancient cities of Crete, where
the Quince tree is indigenous, and whence it derived its
name of Pyrus Cydonia, or simply Cydonia. If not indigenous
elsewhere in the East, it was very soon cultivated,
and especially in Palestine. It is not yet a settled point,
and probably never will be, but there is a strong consensus
of most of the best commentators, that the <i>Tappuach</i> of
Scripture, always translated Apple, was the Quince. It is
supposed to be the fruit alluded to in the Canticles, "As
the Apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my
beloved among the sons; I sat down under his shadow
with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste;"
and in Proverbs, "A word fitly spoken is like Apples of
gold in pictures of silver;" and the tree is supposed to have
given its name to various places in Palestine, as Tappuach,
Beth-Tappuach, and Aen-Tappuach.</p>

<p>By the Greeks and Romans the Quince was held in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>[<a href="./images/235.png">235</a>]</span>honour as the fruit especially sacred to Venus, who is often
represented as holding a Quince in her right hand, the gift
which she received from Paris. In other sculptures "the
amorous deities pull Quinces in gardens and play with them.
For persons to send Quinces in presents, to throw them at
each other, to eat them together, were all tokens of love; to
dream of Quinces was a sign of successful love" (Rosenmuller).
The custom was handed down to medi&aelig;val times. It was at
a wedding feast that "they called for Dates and Quinces in
the pastry;" and Brand quotes a curious passage from the
"Praise of Musicke," 1586 ("Romeo and Juliet" was published
in 1596)&mdash;"I come to marriages, wherein as our
ancestors did fondly, and with a kind of doting, maintaine
many rites and ceremonies, some whereof were either
shadowes or abodements of a pleasant life to come, as the
eating of a Quince Peare to be a preparative of sweet and
delightful dayes between the married persons."</p>

<p>To understand this high repute in which the Quince was
held, we must remember that the Quince of hot countries
differs somewhat from the English Quince. With us the
fruit is of a fine, handsome shape, and of a rich golden
colour when fully ripe, and of a strong scent, which is very
agreeable to many, though too heavy and overpowering to
others. But the rind is rough and woolly, and the flesh is
harsh and unpalatable, and only fit to be eaten when cooked.
In hotter countries the woolly rind is said to disappear, and
the fruit can be eaten raw; and this is the case not only in
Eastern countries, but also in the parts of Tropical America
to which the tree has been introduced from Europe.</p>

<p>In England the Quince is probably less grown now than
it was in Shakespeare's time&mdash;yet it may well be grown as an
ornamental shrub even by those who do not appreciate its
fruit. It forms a thick bush, with large white flowers,
followed in the autumn by its handsome fruit, and requires
no care. "They love shadowy, moist places;" "It delighteth
to grow on plaine and even ground and somewhat moist withall."
This was Lyte's and Gerard's experience, and I have
never seen handsomer bushes or finer fruit than I once saw
on some neglected bushes that skirted a horsepond on a farm
in Kent; the trees were evidently revelling in their state of
moisture and neglect. The tree has a horticultural value as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>[<a href="./images/236.png">236</a>]</span>giving an excellent stock for Pear-trees, on which it has a
very remarkable effect, for "Cabanis asserts that when certain
Pears are grafted on the Quince, their seeds yield more
varieties than do the seeds of the same variety of Pear
when grafted on the wild Pear."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Darwin.</span> Its economic
value is considered to be but small, being chiefly used for
Marmalade,<a name="FNanchor_236:1_167" id="FNanchor_236:1_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_236:1_167" class="fnanchor">[236:1]</a> but in Shakespeare's time, Browne spoke of it
as "the stomach's comforter, the pleasing Quince," and
Parkinson speaks highly of it, for "there is no fruit growing
in the land," he says, "that is of so many excellent uses as
this, serving as well to make many dishes of meat for the
table, as for banquets, and much more for their physical
virtues, whereof to write at large is neither convenient for
me nor for this work."</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the Radish was so named
because it was considered by the Romans, for some reason
unknown to us, <i>the</i> root <i>par excellence</i>. It was used by
them, as by us, "as a stimulus before meat, giving an appetite
thereunto"&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>But it was cultivated, or allowed to grow, to a much larger
size than we now think desirable. Pliny speaks of Radishes
weighing 40lb. each, and others speak even of 60lb. and
100lb. But in Shakespeare's time the Radish was very
much what it is now, a pleasant salad vegetable, but of no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>[<a href="./images/237.png">237</a>]</span>great value. We read, however, of Radishes being put to
strange uses. Lupton, a writer of Shakespeare's day, says:
"If you would kill snakes and adders strike them with a
large Radish, and to handle adders and snakes without harm,
wash your hands in the juice of Radishes and you may do
without harm" ("Notable Things," 1586).</p>

<p>We read also of great attempts being made to procure oil
from the seed, but to no great effect. Hakluyt, in describing
the sufficiency of the English soil to produce everything
necessary in the manufacture of cloth, says: "So as there
wanteth, if colours might be brought in and made naturall,
but onely oile; the want whereof if any man could devise
to supply at the full with anything that might become naturall
in this realme, he, whatsoever he were that might bring it
about, might deserve immortal fame in this our Commonwealth,
and such a devise was offered to Parliament and
refused, because they denied to allow him a certain liberty,
some others having obtained the same before that practised
to work that effect by Radish seed, which onely made a trial
of small quantity, and that went no further to make that
oile in plenty, and now he that offered this devise was a
merchant, and is dead, and withal the devise is dead with
him" ("Voiages," vol. ii.).</p>

<p>The Radish is not a native of Britain, but was probably
introduced by the Romans, and was well-known to the Anglo-Saxon
gardener under its present name, but with a closer
approach to the Latin, being called R&aelig;dic, or Radiolle.<a name="FNanchor_237:1_168" id="FNanchor_237:1_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_237:1_168" class="fnanchor">[237:1]</a></p>

<p>A curious testimony to the former high reputation of the
Radish survives in the "Annual Radish Feast at Levens
Hall, a custom dating from time immemorial, and supposed
by some to be a relic of feudal times, held on May 12th at
Levens Hall, the seat of the Hon. Mrs. Howard, and adjoining
the high road about midway between Kendal and Milnthorpe.
Tradition hath it that the Radish feast arose out
of a rivalry between the families of Levens Hall and Dallam
Tower, as to which should entertain the Corporation with
their friends and followers, and in which Levens Hall
eventually carried the palm. The feast is provided on the
bowling green in front of the Hall, where several long tables
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>[<a href="./images/238.png">238</a>]</span>are plentifully spread with Radishes and brown bread and
butter, the tables being repeatedly furnished with guests"
("Gardener's Chronicle").</p>

<p>Raisins are alluded to, if not actually named, in "1st
Henry IV.," act ii, sc. 4, when Falstaff says: "If reasons
were as plentiful as Blackberries, I would give no man a
reason upon compulsion, I&mdash;&mdash;" "It seems that a pun
underlies this, the association of reasons with Blackberries
springing out of the fact that <i>reasons</i> sounded like <i>raisins</i>."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Earle</span>,
<i>Philology</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind that Raisin is a corruption of <i>racemus</i>, a
bunch of Grapes, we can understand that the word was not
always applied, as it is now, to the dried fruit, but was sometimes
applied to the bunch of Grapes as it hung ripe on the
tree&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For no man at the firste stroke<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Romaunt of the Rose.</i></p>

<p>The best dried fruit were Raisins of the sun, <i>i.e.</i>, dried in
the sun, to distinguish them from those which were dried in
ovens. They were, of course, foreign fruit, and were largely
imported. The process of drying in the sun is still the
method in use, at least, with "the finer kinds, such as
Muscatels, which are distinguished as much by the mode
of drying as by the variety and soil in which they are grown,
the finest being dried on the Vines before gathering, the
stalk being partly cut through when the fruits are ripe, and
the leaves being removed from near the clusters, so as to
allow the full effect of the sun in ripening."</p>

<p>The Grape thus becomes a Raisin, but it is still further
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>[<a href="./images/239.png">239</a>]</span>transformed when it reaches the cook; it then becomes a
Plum, for Plum pudding has, as we all know, Raisins for its
chief ingredient and certainly no Plums; and the Christmas
pie into which Jack Horner put in his thumb and pulled out
a Plum must have been a mince-pie, also made of Raisins;
but how a cooked Raisin came to be called a Plum is not
recorded. In Devonshire and Dorsetshire it undergoes a
further transformation, for there Raisins are called Figs, and
a Plum pudding is called a Fig pudding.</p>

<p>Reed is a general term for almost any water-loving, grassy
plant, and so it is used by Shakespeare. In the Bible it is
perhaps possible to identify some of the Reeds mentioned,
with the Sugar Cane in some places, with the Papyrus in
others, and in others with the Arundo donax. As a Biblical
plant it has a special interest, not only as giving the emblem
of the tenderest mercy that will be careful even of "the
bruised Reed," but also as entering largely into the mockery
of the Crucifixion: "They put a Reed in His right hand,"
and "they filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put it upon a
Reed and gave Him to drink." The Reed in these passages
was probably the Arundo donax, a very elegant Reed, which
was used for many purposes in Palestine, and is a most
graceful plant for English gardens, being perfectly hardy,
and growing every year from 12ft. to 14ft. in height, but
very seldom flowering.<a name="FNanchor_240:1_169" id="FNanchor_240:1_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_240:1_169" class="fnanchor">[240:1]</a></p>

<p>But in Shakespeare, as in most writers, the Reed is
simply the emblem of weakness, tossed about by and bending
to a superior force, and of little or no use&mdash;"a Reed that
will do me no service" (No. <a href="#Reed_1">1</a>). It is also the emblem of
the blessedness of submission, and of the power that lies in
humility to outlast its oppressor&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Like as in tempest great,<br /></span>

<span class="i0i">Much safer stands the bowing Reed<br /></span>
<span class="i1i">Then doth the stubborn Oak."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Shakespeare mentions but two uses to which the Reed was
applied, the thatching of houses (No. <a href="#Reed_3">3</a>), and the making of
Pan or Shepherd's pipes (No. <a href="#Reed_6">6</a>). Nor has he anything to
say of its beauty, yet the Reeds of our river sides (<i>Arundo</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>[<a href="./images/241.png">241</a>]</span><i>phragmites</i>) are most graceful plants, especially when they
have their dark plumes of flowers, and this Milton seems to
have felt&mdash;</p>

<p>Andrew Boorde writing from Spayne in 1535, to Thomas
Cromwell, says, "I have sent to your Mastershipp the seeds
of Reuberbe the whiche come forth of Barbary in this
parte ytt ys had for a grett tresure."<a name="FNanchor_241:1_170" id="FNanchor_241:1_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_241:1_170" class="fnanchor">[241:1]</a> But the plant
does not seem to have become established and Shakespeare
could only have known the imported drug, for the
Rheum was first grown by Parkinson, though it had
been described in an uncertain way both by Lyte and
Gerard. Lyte said: "Rha, as it is thought, hath great
broad leaves;" and then he says: "We have found here in
the gardens of certaine diligent herboristes that strange
plant which is thought by some to be Rha or Rhabarbum;"
but from the figure it is very certain that the plant was not
a Rheum. After the time of Parkinson, it was largely grown
for the sake of producing the drug, and it is still grown in
England to some extent for the same purpose, chiefly in the
neighbourhood of Banbury; though it is doubtful whether
any of the species now grown in England are the true
species that has long produced Turkey Rhubarb. The plant
is now grown most extensively as a spring vegetable, though I
cannot find when it first began to be so used. Parkinson
evidently tried it and thought well of it. "The leaves have a
fine acid taste; a syrup, therefore, made with the juice and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>[<a href="./images/242.png">242</a>]</span>sugar cannot but be very effectual in dejected appetites."
Yet even in 1807 Professor Martyn, the editor of "Millar's
Dictionary," in a long article on the Rhubarb, makes no
mention of its culinary qualities, but in 1822 Phillips speaks
of it as largely cultivated for spring tarts, and forced for the
London markets, "medical men recommending it as one of
the most cooling and wholesome tarts sent to table."</p>

<p>As a garden plant the Rhubarb is highly ornamental,
though it is seldom seen out of the kitchen garden, but
where room can be given to them, Rheum palmatum or
Rheum officinale, will always be admired as some of the
handsomest of foliage plants. The finest species of the
family is the Himalayan Rheum nobile, but it is exceedingly
difficult to grow. Botanically the Rhubarb is allied to the
Dock and Sorrel, and all the species are herbaceous.</p>

<p>Shakespeare may have had no more acquaintance with
Rice than his knowledge of the imported grain, which
seems to have been long ago introduced into England, for
in a Nominale of the fifteenth century we have "Hoc risi,
indeclinabile, Ryse." And in the "Promptorium Parvulorum,"
"Ryce, frute. Risia, vel risi, n. indecl. secundum
quosdam, vel risium, vel risorum granum (rizi vel granum
Indicum)." Turner was acquainted with it: "Ryse groweth
plentuously in watery myddowes between Myllane and
Pavia."<a name="FNanchor_242:2_172" id="FNanchor_242:2_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_242:2_172" class="fnanchor">[242:2]</a> And Shakespeare may have seen the plant, for
Gerard grew it in his London garden, though "the floure
did not show itselfe by reason of the injurie of our unseasonable
yeare 1596." It is a native of Africa, and was soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>[<a href="./images/243.png">243</a>]</span>transferred to Europe as a nourishing and wholesome grain,
especially for invalids&mdash;"sume hoc ptisanarium oryz&aelig;,"
says the doctor to his patient in Horace, and it is mentioned
both by Dioscorides and Theophrastus. It has been occasionally
grown in England as a curiosity, but seldom comes
to any perfection out-of-doors, as it requires a mixture of
moisture and heat that we cannot easily give it. There are
said to be species in the North of China growing in dry
places, which would perhaps be hardy in England and easier
of cultivation, but I am not aware that they have ever been
introduced.</p>

<p>In addition to these many passages, there are perhaps
thirty more in which the Rose is mentioned with reference
to the Red and White Roses of the houses of York and
Lancaster. To quote these it would be necessary to extract
an entire act, which is very graphic, but too long. I must,
therefore, content myself with the beginning and the end
of the chief scene, and refer the reader who desires to see it
<i>in extenso</i> to "1st Henry VI.," act ii, sc. 4. The scene is in
the Temple Gardens, and Plantagenet and Somerset thus
begin the fatal quarrel&mdash;</p>

<p>And Warwick's wise conclusion on the whole matter is&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8h">This brawl to-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grown to this faction in the Temple Garden,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall send, between the Red Rose and the White,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand souls to death and deadly night.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There are further allusions to the same Red and White
Roses in "3rd Henry VI.," act i, sc. 1 and 2, act ii, sc. 5, and
act v, sc. 1; "1st Henry VI.," act iv, sc. 1; and "Richard
III.," act v, sc. 4.</p>

<p>There is no flower so often mentioned by Shakespeare as
the Rose, and he would probably consider it the queen of
flowers, for it was so deemed in his time. "The Rose doth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a>[<a href="./images/249.png">249</a>]</span>deserve the cheefest and most principall place among all
flowers whatsoever, being not onely esteemed for his beautie,
vertues, and his fragrant and odoriferous smell, but also
because it is the honore and ornament of our English
Scepter."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gerard.</span> Yet the kingdom of the Rose even
then was not undisputed; the Lily was always its rival (<i>see</i>
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Lily">Lily</a></span>), for thus sang Walter de Biblesworth in the thirteenth
century&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"En &ccedil;o verger troveroums les flurs<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Des queus issunt les doux odours (swote smel)<br /></span>

<span class="i0i">Liz vaut per royne, Rose pur piz."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But a little later the great Scotch poet Dunbar, who lived
from 1460 to 1520, that is, a century before Shakespeare,
asserted the dignity of the Rose as even superior to the
Thistle of Scotland.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nor hold none other flower in sic dainty<br /></span>

<p>Volumes have been written, and many more may still be
written, on the delights of the Rose, but my present business
is only with the Roses of Shakespeare. In many of the
above passages the Rose is simply the emblem of all that is
loveliest and brightest and most beautiful upon earth, yet
always with the underlying sentiment that even the brightest
has its dark side, as the Rose has its thorns; that the
worthiest objects of our earthly love are at the very best but
short-lived; that the most beautiful has on it the doom of
decay and death. These were the lessons which even the
heathen writers learned from their favourite Roses, and
which Christian writers of all ages loved to learn also, not
from the heathen writers, but from the beautiful flowers
themselves. "The Rose is a beautiful flower," said St. Basil,
"but it always fills me with sorrow by reminding me of my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>[<a href="./images/250.png">250</a>]</span>sins, for which the earth was doomed to bear thorns." And
it would be easy to fill a volume, and it would not be a
cheerless volume, with beautiful and expressive passages from
poets, preachers, and other authors, who have taken the Rose
to point the moral of the fleeting nature of all earthly things.
Herrick in four lines tells the whole&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>But Shakespeare's notices of the Rose are not all emblematical
and allegorical. He mentions these distinct sorts of
Roses&mdash;the Red Rose, the White Rose, the Musk Rose, the
Proven&ccedil;al Rose, the Damask Rose, the Variegated Rose,
the Canker Rose, and the Sweet Briar.</p>

<p>The Canker Rose is the wild Dog Rose, and the name is
sometimes applied to the common Red Poppy.</p>

<p>The Red Rose and the Proven&ccedil;al Rose (No. <a href="#Rose_13">13</a>) are no
doubt the same, and are what we now call R. centifolia, or
the Cabbage Rose; a Rose that has been supposed to be a
native of the South of Europe, but Dr. Lindley preferred "to
place its native country in Asia, because it has been found
wild by Bieberstein with double flowers, on the eastern side
of Mount Caucasus, whither it is not likely to have escaped
from a garden."<a name="FNanchor_250:1_175" id="FNanchor_250:1_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_250:1_175" class="fnanchor">[250:1]</a> We do not know when it was introduced
into England, but it was familiar to Chaucer&mdash;</p>

<p><i>i.e.</i>, in Provence, at the mouth of the Rhone. For beauty in
shape and exquisite fragrance, I consider this Rose to be
still unrivalled; but it is not a fashionable Rose, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>[<a href="./images/251.png">251</a>]</span>is usually found in cottage gardens, or perhaps in some
neglected part of gardens of more pretensions. I believe
it is considered too loose in shape to satisfy the floral critics
of exhibition flowers, and it is only a summer Rose, and so
contrasts unfavourably with the Hybrid Perpetuals. Still,
it is a delightful Rose, delightful to the eye, delightful for
its fragrance, and most delightful from its associations.</p>

<p>The White Rose of York (No. <a href="#Rose_20">20</a>) has never been satisfactorily
identified. It was clearly a cultivated Rose, and by
some is supposed to have been only the wild White Rose
(<i>R. arvensis</i>) grown in a garden. But it is very likely to
have been the Rosa alba, which was a favourite in English
gardens in Shakespeare's time, and was very probably introduced
long before his time, for it is the double variety of
the wild White Rose, and Gerard says of it: "The double
White Rose doth grow wilde in many hedges of Lancashire
in great abundance, even as Briers do with us in these
southerly parts, especially in a place of the countrey called
Leyland, and in a place called Roughford, not far from
Latham." It was, therefore, not a new gardener's plant in
his time, as has been often stated. I have little doubt that
this is the White Rose of York; it is not the R. alba of Dr.
Lindley's monograph, but the double variety of the British
R. arvensis.</p>

<p>The White Rose has a very ancient interest for Englishmen,
for "long before the brawl in the Temple Gardens,
the flower had been connected with one of the most ancient
names of our island. The elder Pliny, in discussing the
etymology of the word Albion, suggests that the land may
have been so named from the White Roses which abounded
in it&mdash;'Albion insula sic dicta ab albis rupibus, quas mare
alluit, vel ob rosas albas quibus abundat.' Whatever we
may think of the etymological skill displayed in the
suggestion .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we look with almost a new pleasure on the Roses
of our own hedgerows, when regarding them as descended
in a straight line from the 'rosas albas' of those far-off
summers."&mdash;<i>Quarterly Review</i>, vol. cxiv.</p>

<p>The Damask Rose (No. <a href="#Rose_5">5</a>) remains to us under the same
name, telling its own history. There can be little doubt
that the Rose came from Damascus, probably introduced
into Europe by the Crusaders or some of the early travellers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>[<a href="./images/252.png">252</a>]</span>in the East, who speak in glowing terms of the beauties of
the gardens of Damascus. So Sir John Mandeville describes
the city&mdash;"In that Cytee of Damasce, there is gret plentee
of Welles, and with in the Cytee and with oute, ben many
fayre Gardynes and of dyverse frutes. Non other Cytee is
not lyche in comparison to it, of fayre Gardynes, and of
fayre desportes."&mdash;<i>Voiage and Travaile</i>, cap. xi. And
in our own day the author of "E&ouml;then" described the same
gardens as he saw them: "High, high above your head,
and on every side all down to the ground, the thicket is
hemmed in and choked up by the interlacing boughs that
droop with the weight of Roses, and load the slow air with
their damask breath. There are no other flowers. The
Rose trees which I saw were all of the kind we call
'damask;' they grow to an immense height and size."&mdash;<i>E&ouml;then</i>,
ch. xxvii. It was not till long after the Crusades
that the Damask Rose was introduced into England, for
Hakluyt in 1582 says: "In time of memory many things
have been brought in that were not here before, as the
Damaske Rose by Doctour Linaker, King Henry the Seventh
and King Henrie the Eight's Physician."&mdash;<i>Voiages</i>, vol. ii.<a name="FNanchor_252:1_176" id="FNanchor_252:1_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_252:1_176" class="fnanchor">[252:1]</a></p>

<p>As an ornamental Rose the Damask Rose is still a
favourite, though probably the real typical Rosa Damascena
is very seldom seen&mdash;but it has been the parent of a large
number of hybrid Roses, which the most critical Rosarian
does not reject. The whole family are very sweet-scented,
so that "sweet as Damask Roses" was a proverb, and
Gerard describes the common Damaske as "in other
respects like the White Rose; the especiale difference consisteth
in the colour and smell of the floures, for these are
of a pale red colour and of a more pleasant smell, and fitter
for meate or medicine."</p>

<p>The Musk Roses (No. <a href="#Rose_1">1</a>) were great favourites with our
forefathers. This Rose (<i>R. moschata</i>) is a native of the North
of Africa and of Spain, and has been also found in Nepaul.
Hakluyt gives the exact date of its introduction. "The
turkey cockes and hennes," he says, "were brought about
fifty yeres past, the Artichowe in time of King Henry the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>[<a href="./images/253.png">253</a>]</span>Eight, and of later times was procured out of Italy the
Muske Rose plant, the Plumme called the Perdigwena, and
two kindes more by the Lord Cromwell after his travel."&mdash;<i>Voiages</i>,
vol. ii. It is a long straggling Rose, bearing
bunches of single flowers, and is very seldom seen except
against the walls of some old houses. "You remember the
great bush at the corner of the south wall just by the blue
drawing-room windows; that is the old Musk Rose, Shakespeare's
Musk Rose, which is dying out through the kingdom
now."&mdash;<i>My Lady Ludlow</i>, by Mrs. Gaskell. But wherever
it is grown it is highly prized, not so much for the beauty as
for the delicate scent of its flowers. The scent is unlike
the scent of any other Rose, or of any other flower, but it is
very pleasant, and not overpowering; and the plant has the
peculiarity that, like the Sweet Briar, but unlike other
Roses, it gives out its scent of its own accord and unsought,
and chiefly in the evening, so that if the window of a bedroom
near which this rose is trained is left open, the scent
will soon be perceived in the room. This peculiarity did
not escape the notice of Lord Bacon. "Because the breath
of flowers," he says, "is far sweeter in the air (when it comes
and goes like the warbling of music) than in the hand,
therefore nothing is more fit for that delight than to know
what be the flowers and plants that do best perfume the air.
Roses, damask and red, are fast flowers of their smells, so
that you may walk by a whole row of them, and find nothing
of their sweetness, yea, though it be in a morning's dew.
Bays, likewise, yield no smell as they grow, Rosemary little,
nor Sweet Marjoram; that which above all others yields the
sweetest smell in the air is the Violet, especially the white
double Violet which comes twice a year, about the middle
of April, and about Bartholomew-tide; next to that is the
Musk-rose."&mdash;<i>Essay of Gardens.</i></p>

<p>The Roses mentioned in Nos. <a href="#Rose_34">34</a>, <a href="#Rose_51">51</a>, and <a href="#Rose_52">52</a> as a mixture
of red and white must have been the mottled or variegated
Roses, commonly called the York and Lancaster Roses;<a name="FNanchor_253:1_177" id="FNanchor_253:1_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_253:1_177" class="fnanchor">[253:1]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>[<a href="./images/254.png">254</a>]</span>these are old Roses, and very probably quite as old as the
sixteenth century. There are two varieties: in one each
petal is blotched with white and pink; this is the R. versicolor
of Parkinson, and is a variety of R. Damascena; in the
other most of the petals are white, but with a mixture of
pink petals; this is the Rosa mundi or Gloria mundi, and is
a variety of R. Gallica.</p>

<p>These, with the addition of the Eglantine or Sweet Brier
(<i>see</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#Eglantine">Eglantine</a></span>), are the only Roses that Shakespeare
directly names, and they were the chief sorts grown in his
time, but not the only sorts; and to what extent Roses were
cultivated in Shakespeare's time we have a curious proof in
the account of the grant of Ely Place, in Holborn, the property
of the Bishops of Ely. "The tenant was Sir Christopher
Hatton (Queen Elizabeth's handsome Lord Chancellor)
to whom the greater portion of the house was let in 1576 for
the term of twenty-one years. The rent was a Red Rose,
ten loads of hay, and ten pounds per annum; Bishop Cox,
on whom this hard bargain was forced by the Queen, reserving
to himself and his successors the right of walking in the
gardens, and gathering twenty bushels of Roses yearly."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cunningham.</span>
We have records also of the garden cultivation
of the Rose in London long before Shakespeare's time.
"In the Earl of Lincoln's garden in Holborn in 24 Edw. I.,
the only flowers named are Roses, of which a quantity was
sold, producing three shillings and twopence."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hudson
Turner.</span></p>

<p>My space forbids me to enter more largely into any
account of these old species, or to say much of the many
very interesting points in the history of the Rose, but two or
three points connected with Shakespeare's Roses must not
be passed over. First, its name. He says through Juliet
(No. <a href="#Rose_36">36</a>) that the Rose by any other name would smell as
sweet. But the whole world is against him. Rose was its
old Latin name corrupted from its older Greek name, and
the same name, with slight and easily-traced differences, has
clung to it in almost all European countries.</p>

<p>Shakespeare also mentions its uses in Rose-water and
Rose-cakes, and it was only natural to suppose that a flower
so beautiful and so sweet was meant by Nature to be of great
use to man. Accordingly we find that wonderful virtues
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>[<a href="./images/255.png">255</a>]</span>were attributed to it,<a name="FNanchor_255:1_178" id="FNanchor_255:1_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_255:1_178" class="fnanchor">[255:1]</a> and an especial virtue was attributed
to the dewdrops that settled on the full-blown Rose. Shakespeare
alludes to these in Nos. <a href="#Rose_22">22</a> and <a href="#Rose_27">27</a>; and from these
were made cosmetics only suited to the most extravagant.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The water that did spryng from ground<br /></span>
<span class="i1i">She would not touch at all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">But washt her hands with dew of Heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i1i">That on sweet Roses fall."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>The Lamentable Fall of Queen Ellinor.</i>&mdash;Roxburghe Ballads.</p>

<p>And as with their uses, so it was also with their history.
Such a flower must have a high origin, and what better
origin than the pretty medi&aelig;val legend told to us by Sir
John Mandeville?&mdash;"At Betheleim is the Felde <i>Floridus</i>,
that is to seyne, the <i>Feld florisched</i>; for als moche as a fayre
mayden was blamed with wrong and sclaundered, for whiche
cause sche was demed to the Dethe, and to be brent in that
place, to the whiche she was ladd; and as the Fyre began to
brent about hire, sche made hire preyeres to oure Lord, that
als wissely as sche was not gylty of that Synne, that He
wolde helpe hire and make it to be knowen to alle men, of
his mercyfulle grace. And when sche hadde thus seyd, sche
entered into the Fuyr; and anon was the Fuyr quenched
and oute; and the Brondes that weren brennynge becomen
red Roseres, and the Brondes that weren not kyndled becomen
white Roseres, full of Roses. And these weren the
first Roseres and Roses, both white and rede, that evere ony
man saughe."&mdash;<i>Voiage and Travaile</i>, cap. vi.</p>

<p>With this pretty legend I may well conclude the account
of Shakespeare's Roses, commending, however, M. Biron's
sensible remarks on unseasonable flowers (No. <a href="#Rose_26">26</a>) to those
who estimate the beauty of a flower or anything else in proportion
to its being produced out of its natural season.</p>

<p>The Rosemary is not a native of Britain, but of the sea-coast
of the South of Europe, where it is very abundant. It
was very early introduced into England, and is mentioned in
an Anglo-Saxon Herbarium under its Latin name of Ros
marinus, and is there translated by Bothen, <i>i.e.</i> Thyme; also
in an Anglo-Saxon Vocabulary of the eleventh century, where
it is translated Feld-madder and Sun-dew. In these places
our present plant may or may not be meant, but there is no
doubt that it is the one referred to in an ancient English
poem of the fourteenth century, on the virtues of herbs,
published in Wright and Halliwell's "Reliqui&aelig; Antiqu&aelig;."
The account of "The Gloriouse Rosemaryne" is long, but
the beginning and ending are worth quoting&mdash;</p>

<p>We can now scarcely understand the high favour in which
Rosemary was formerly held; we are accustomed to see it
neglected, or only tolerated in some corner of the kitchen
garden, and not often tolerated there. But it was very
different in Shakespeare's time, when it was in high favour
for its evergreen leaves and fine aromatic scent, remaining
a long time after picking, so long, indeed, that both leaves
and scent were almost considered everlasting. This was its
great charm, and so Spenser spoke of it as "the cheerful
Rosemarie" and "refreshing Rosemarine," and good Sir
Thomas More had a great affection for it. "As for Rosemarine,"
he said, "I lett it run alle over my garden walls,
not onlie because my bees love it, but because tis the herb
sacred to remembrance, and therefore to friendship; whence
a sprig of it hath a dumb language that maketh it the chosen
emblem at our funeral wakes and in our buriall grounds."
And Parkinson gives a similar account of its popularity as a
garden plant: "Being in every woman's garden, it were
sufficient but to name it as an ornament among other sweet
herbs and flowers in our gardens. In this our land, where
it hath been planted in noblemen's and great men's gardens
against brick walls, and there continued long, it riseth up in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>[<a href="./images/258.png">258</a>]</span>time unto a very great height, with a great and woody stem
of that compasse that, being cloven out into boards, it hath
served to make lutes or such like instruments, and here with
us carpenters' rules and to divers others purposes." It was
the favourite evergreen wherever the occasion required an
emblem of constancy and perpetual remembrance, such
especially as weddings and funerals, at both of which it was
largely used; and so says Herrick of "The Rosemarie
Branch"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Grow for two ends, it matters not at all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Be't for my bridall or my buriall."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Its use at funerals was very widespread, for Laurembergius
records a pretty custom in use in his day, 1631, at Frankfort:
"Is mos apud nos retinetur, dum cupresso humile, vel
rore marino, non solum coronamus funera jamjam ducenda,
sed et iis appendimus ex iisdem herbis litteras collectas,
significatrices nominis ejus qu&aelig; defuncta est. Nam in
puellarum funeribus h&aelig;c fere fieri solent" ("Horticultur&aelig;,"
cap. vj.).</p>

<p>Its use at weddings is pleasantly told in the old ballad of
"The Bride's Good-morrow"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The house is drest and garnisht for your sake<br /></span>
<span class="i1i">With flowers gallant and green;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">A solemn feast your comely cooks do ready make,<br /></span>
<span class="i1i">Where all your friends will be seen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Young men and maids do ready stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">With sweet Rosemary in their hand&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1i">A perfect token of your virgin's life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">To wait upon you they intend<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Unto the church to make an end:<br /></span>
<span class="i1i">And God make thee a joyfull wedded wife."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Roxburghe Ballads</i>, vol. i.</p>

<p>It probably is one of the most lasting of evergreens after
being gathered, though we can scarcely credit the statement
recorded by Phillips that "it is the custom in France to put
a branch of Rosemary in the hands of the dead when in the
coffin, and we are told by Valmont Bomare, in his 'Histoire
Naturelle,' that when the coffins have been opened after
several years, the plant has been found to have vegetated so
much that the leaves have covered the corpse." These were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>[<a href="./images/259.png">259</a>]</span>the general and popular uses of the Rosemary, but it was of
high repute as a medicine, and still holds a place, though
not so high as formerly, in the "Pharmacop&oelig;ia." "Rosemary,"
says Parkinson, "is almost of as great use as Bayes,
both for inward and outward remedies, and as well for civill
as physicall purposes&mdash;inwardly for the head and heart, outwardly
for the sinews and joynts; for civile uses, as all do
know, at weddings, funerals, &amp;c., to bestow among friends;
and the physicall are so many that you might as well be
tyred in the reading as I in the writing, if I should set down
all that might be said of it."</p>

<p>With this high character we may well leave this good, old-fashioned
plant, merely noting that the name is popularly
but erroneously supposed to mean the Rose of Mary. It
has no connection with either Rose or Mary, but is the Ros
marinus, or Ros Maris (as in Ovid&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ros maris, et laurus, nigraque myrtus olent;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>De Arte Aman.</i>, iii, 390),</p>

<p>the plant that delights in the sea-spray; and so the old
spelling was Rosmarin. Gower says of the Star Alpheta&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His herbe proper is Rosmarine;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<span class="i0">"And here trim Rosmarin that whilom crowned<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The daintiest garden of the proudest peer."<br /></span>

chests and presses among clothes, to preserve them from
mothes and other vermine."</p>

<p>Comparing (<a href="#Rue_2">2</a>) and (<a href="#Rue_3">3</a>) together, there is little doubt that the
same herb is alluded to in both; and it is, perhaps, alluded
to, though not exactly named, in the following:</p>

<p>Shakespeare thus gives us the two names for the same
plant, Rue and Herb of Grace, and though at first sight
there seems to be little or no connection between the two
names, yet really they are so closely connected, that the one
name was derived from, or rather suggested by, the other.
Rue is the English form of the Greek and Latin <i>ruta</i>, a word
which has never been explained, and in its earlier English
form of <i>rude</i> came still nearer to the Latin original. But
<i>ruth</i> was the English word for sorrow and remorse, and <i>to
rue</i> was to be sorry for anything, or to have pity;<a name="FNanchor_260:1_180" id="FNanchor_260:1_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_260:1_180" class="fnanchor">[260:1]</a> we still
say a man will rue a particular action, <i>i.e.</i>, be sorry for it;
and so it was a natural thing to say that a plant which was
so bitter, and had always borne the name <i>Rue</i> or <i>Ruth</i>, must
be connected with repentance. It was, therefore, the Herb
of Repentance, and this was soon transformed into the Herb
of Grace (in 1838 Loudon said, "It is to this day called Ave
Grace in Sussex"), repentance being the chief sign of grace;
and it is not unlikely that this idea was strengthened by the
connection of Rue with the bitter herbs of the Bible, though
it is only once mentioned, and then with no special remark,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>[<a href="./images/261.png">261</a>]</span>except as a tithable garden herb, together with Anise and
Cummin.</p>

<p>The Rue, like Lavender and Rosemary, is a native of the
more barren parts of the coasts of the Mediterranean, and
has been found on Mount Tabor, but it was one of the
earliest occupants of the English Herb garden. It is very
frequently mentioned in the Saxon Leech Books, and
entered so largely into their prescriptions that it must have
been very extensively grown. Its strong aromatic smell,<a name="FNanchor_261:1_181" id="FNanchor_261:1_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_261:1_181" class="fnanchor">[261:1]</a>
and bitter taste, with the blistering quality of the leaves,
soon established its character as almost a heal-all.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0i">Mekyl of myth and vertu is."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Stockholm MS.</i>, 1305.</p>

<p>Even beasts were supposed to have discovered its virtues,
so that weasels were gravely said, and this by such men as
Pliny, to eat Rue when they were preparing themselves for
a fight with rats and serpents. Its especial virtue was an
eye-salve, a use which Milton did not overlook&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">Michael from Adam's eyes the filme removed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which that false fruit which promised clearer sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had bred; then purged with Euphrasie and Rue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The visual nerve, for he had much to see:"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Paradise Lost</i>, book xi.;</p>

<p>and which was more fully stated in the old lines of the
Schola Salerni&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nobilis est Ruta quia lumina reddit acuta;<br /></span>

<span class="i0i">Ruta facit castum, dat lumen, et ingerit astum;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Cocta facit Ruta et de pollicibus loca tuta."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After reading this high moral and physical character of
the herb, it is rather startling to find that "It is believed
that if stolen from a neighbour's garden it would prosper
better." It was, however, an old belief&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"They sayen eke stolen sede is butt the bette."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Palladius on Husbandrie</i> (c. 1420) iv, 269.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>[<a href="./images/262.png">262</a>]</span>
"It is a common received opinion that Rue will grow the
better if it bee filtched out of another man's garden."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Holland's</span>
<i>Pliny</i>, xix. 7.</p>

<p>As other medicines were introduced the Rue declined in
favour, so that Parkinson spoke of it with qualified praise&mdash;"Without
doubt it is a most wholesom herb, although
bitter and strong. Some do rip up a bead-rowl of the
virtues of Rue, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but beware of the too-frequent or overmuch
use therof." And Dr. Daubeny says of it, "It is a
powerful stimulant and narcotic, but not much used in
modern practise."</p>

<p>As a garden plant, the Rue forms a pretty shrub for a
rock-work, if somewhat attended to, so as to prevent its
becoming straggling and untidy. The delicate green and
peculiar shape of the leaves give it a distinctive character,
which forms a good contrast to other plants.</p>

In Nos. <a href="#Rush_3">3</a> and <a href="#Rush_18">18</a> reference is made to the Rush-ring, a ring,

honest betrothal, but afterwards so vilely used for the purposes
of mock marriages, that even as early as 1217 Richard
Bishop of Salisbury had to issue his edict against the use of
"annulum de junco."</p>

<p>But the uses of the Rush were not all bad. Newton, in
1587, said of the Rush&mdash;"It is a round smooth shoote
without joints or knots, having within it a white substance
or pith, which being drawn forth showeth like long white,
soft, gentle, and round thread, and serveth for many purposes.
Heerewith be made manie pretie imagined devises
for Bride-ales and other solemnities, as little baskets,
hampers, frames, pitchers, dishes, combs, brushes, stooles,
chaires, purses with strings, girdles, and manie such other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>[<a href="./images/265.png">265</a>]</span>pretie and curious and artificiall conceits, which at such times
many do take the paines to make and hang up in their
houses, as tokens of good will to the new married Bride;
and after the solemnities ended, to bestow abroad for Bride-gifts
or presents." It was this "white substance or pith"
from which the Rush candle (No. <a href="#Rush_11">11</a>) was and still is made:
a candle which in early days was probably the universal
candle, which, till within a few years, was the night candle
of every sick chamber, in which most of us can recollect it as
a most ghastly object as it used to stand, "stationed in a
basin on the floor, where it glimmered away like a gigantic
lighthouse in a particularly small piece of water" (Pickwick),
till expelled by the night-lights, and which is still
made by Welsh labourers, and, I suppose, in Shakespeare's
time was the only candle used by the poor.</p>

<p>But the chief use of Rushes in those days was to strew
the floors of houses and churches (Nos. <a href="#Rush_4">4</a>, <a href="#Rush_7">7</a>, <a href="#Rush_10">10</a>, <a href="#Rush_12">12</a>, and
<a href="#Rush_14">14</a>). This custom seems to have been universal in all
houses of any pretence. "William the son of William of
Alesbury holds three roods of land of the Lord the King in
Alesbury in Com. Buck by the service of finding straw for
the bed of the Lord the King, and to strew his chamber,
and also of finding for the King when he comes to Alesbury
straw for his bed, and besides this Grass or Rushes
to make his chamber pleasant."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Blunt's</span> <i>Tenures</i>. The
custom went on even to our own day in Norwich Cathedral,
and the "picturesque custom still lingers in the West of
strewing the floors of the churches on Whit Sunday with
Rushes freshly pulled from the meadows. This custom
attains its highest perfection in the church of St. Mary Redcliffe
at Bristol. On 'Rush Sunday' the floor is strewn
with Rushes. All the merchants throw open their conservatories
for the vicar to take his choice of their flowers,
and the pulpit, the lectern, the choir, and the communion
rails and table present a scene of great beauty."&mdash;<i>The
Garden</i>, May, 1877.</p>

For this purpose the Sweet-scented Rush was always
used where it could be procured, and when first laid down
it must have made a pleasant carpet; but it was a sadly
dirty arrangement, and gives us a very poor idea of the
cleanliness of even the best houses, though it probably was
not the custom all through the year, as Newton says, speaking
of Sedges, but evidently confusing the Sedge with the
Sweet-scented Rush, "with the which many in this countrie
do use in sommer time to straw their parlours and churches,
as well for cooleness as for pleasant smell."<a name="FNanchor_266:1_183" id="FNanchor_266:1_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_266:1_183" class="fnanchor">[266:1]</a> This Rush
(<i>Acorus calamus</i>) is a British plant, with broad leaves, which
have a strong cinnamon-like smell, which obtained for the
plant the old Saxon name of Beewort. Another (so-called)
Rush, the Flowering Rush (<i>Butomus umbellatus</i>), is one
of the very handsomest of the British plants, bearing on a
long straight stem a large umbel of very handsome pink
flowers. Wherever there is a pond in a garden, these fine
Rushes should have a place, though they may be grown in
the open border where the ground is not too dry.</p>

<p>There is a story told by Sir John Mandeville in connection
with Rushes which is not easy to understand.
According to his account, our Saviour's crown of thorns
was made of Rushes! "And zif alle it be so that men
seyn that this Croune is of Thornes, zee shall undirstande
that it was of Jonkes of the See, that is to sey, Russhes of
the See, that prykken als scharpely as Thornes. For I
have seen and beholden many times that of Parys and that
of Constantynoble, for thei were bothe on, made of Russches
of the See. But men have departed hem in two parties, of
the which on part is at Parys, and the other part is at Constantynoble&mdash;and
I have on of the precyouse Thornes,
that semethe licke a white Thorn, and that was zoven to
me for great specyaltee.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Jewes setten him in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>[<a href="./images/267.png">267</a>]</span>a chayere and clad him in a mantelle, and then made thei
the Croune of Jonkes of the See."&mdash;<i>Voiage and Travaile,</i>
c. 2.</p>

<p>I have no certainty to what Rush the pleasant old traveller
can here refer. I can only guess that as Rushes and
Sedges were almost interchangeable names, he may have
meant the Sea Holly, formerly called the Holly-sedge, of
which there is a very appropriate account given in an old
Saxon runelay thus translated by Cockayne: "Hollysedge
hath its dwelling oftenest in a marsh, it waxeth in water,
woundeth fearfully, burneth with blood (<i>i.e.</i>, draws blood and
pains) every one of men who to it offers any handling."<a name="FNanchor_267:1_184" id="FNanchor_267:1_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_267:1_184" class="fnanchor">[267:1]</a></p>

<p>The Rye of Shakespeare's time was identical with our
own (<i>Secale cereale</i>). It is not a British plant, and its
native country is not exactly known; but it seems probable
that both the plant and the name came from the region of
the Caucasus.</p>

<p>As a food-plant Rye was not in good repute in Shakespeare's
time. Gerard said of it, "It is harder to digest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>[<a href="./images/268.png">268</a>]</span>than Wheat, yet to rusticke bodies that can well digest it, it
yields good nourishment." But "recent investigations by
Professor Wanklyn and Mr. Cooper appear to give the first
place to Rye as the most nutritious of all our cereals. Rye
contains more gluten, and is pronounced by them one-third
richer than Wheat. Rye, moreover, is capable of thriving
in almost any soil."&mdash;<i>Gardener's Chronicle</i>, 1877.</p>

<p>Saffron (from its Arabic name, <i>al zahafaran</i>) was not, in
Shakespeare's time, limited to the drug or to the Saffron-bearing
Crocus (<i>C. sativus</i>), but it was the general name for
all the Croci, and was even extended to the Colchicums,
which were called Meadow Saffrons.<a name="FNanchor_268:1_185" id="FNanchor_268:1_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_268:1_185" class="fnanchor">[268:1]</a> We have no Crocus
really a native of Britain, but a few species (C. vernus,
C. nudiflorus, C. aureus, and C. biflorus) have been so
naturalized in certain parts as to be admitted, though very
doubtfully, into the British flora; but the Saffron Crocus
can in no way be considered a native, and the history of its
introduction into England is very obscure. It is mentioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>[<a href="./images/269.png">269</a>]</span>several times in the Anglo-Saxon Leech Books: "When he
bathes, let him smear himself with oil; mingle it with
Saffron."&mdash;<i>Tenth Century Leech Book</i>, ii. 37. "For dimness
of eyes, thus one must heal it: take Celandine one spoonful,
and Aloes, and Crocus (Saffron in French)."&mdash;<i>Schools of
Medicine</i>, tenth century, c. 22. In these instances it may
be only the imported drug; but the name occurs in an
English Vocabulary among the Nomina herbarum: "Hic
Crocus, A<sup>e</sup> Safurroun;" and in a Pictorial Vocabulary of the
fourteenth century, "Hic Crocus, An<sup>ce</sup> Safryn;" so that I
think the plant must have been in cultivation in England at
that time. The usual statement, made by one writer after
another, is that it was introduced by Sir Thomas Smith into
the neighbourhood of Walden in the time of Edward III.,
but the original authority for this statement is unknown.
The most authentic account is that by Hakluyt in 1582,
and though it is rather long, it is worth extracting in full.
It occurs in some instructions in "Remembrances for
Master S.," who was going into Turkey, giving him hints
what to observe in his travels: "Saffron, the best of the
universall world, groweth in this realme.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is a spice
that is cordiall, and may be used in meats, and that is excellent
in dying of yellow silks. This commodity of Saffron
groweth fifty miles from Tripoli, in Syria, on an high hyll,
called in those parts Gasian, so as there you may learn at
that part of Tripoli the value of the pound, the goodnesse
of it, and the places of the vent. But it is said that from
that hyll there passeth yerely of that commodity fifteen
moiles laden, and that those regions notwithstanding lacke
sufficiency of that commodity. But if a vent might be found,
men would in Essex (about Saffron Walden), and in Cambridgeshire,
revive the trade for the benefit of the setting of
the poore on worke. So would they do in Herefordshire
by Wales, where the best of all England is, in which place
the soil yields the wilde Saffron commonly, which showeth
the natural inclination of the same soile to the bearing of
the right Saffron, if the soile be manured and that way employed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
It is reported at Saffron Walden that a pilgrim,
proposing to do good to his countrey, stole a head of Saffron,
and hid the same in his Palmer's staffe, which he had made
hollow before of purpose, and so he brought the root into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a>[<a href="./images/270.png">270</a>]</span>this realme with venture of his life, for if he had bene taken,
by the law of the countrey from whence it came, he had died
for the fact."&mdash;<i>English Voiages, &amp;c.</i>, vol. ii. From this account
it seems clear that even in Hakluyt's time Saffron had
been so long introduced that the history of its introduction
was lost; and I think it very probable that, as was suggested
by Coles in his "Adam in Eden" (1657), we are indebted
to the Romans for this, as for so many of our useful plants.
But it is not a Roman or Italian plant. Spenser wrote of
it as&mdash;</p>

<p>which information they derived from Pliny. It is supposed
to be a native of Asia Minor, but so altered by long cultivation
that it never produces seed either in England or in
other parts of Europe.<a name="FNanchor_270:2_187" id="FNanchor_270:2_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_270:2_187" class="fnanchor">[270:2]</a> This fact led M. Chappellier, of
Paris, who has for many years studied the history of the
plant, to the belief that it was a hybrid; but finding that
when fertilized with the pollen of a Crocus found wild in
Greece, and known as C. sativus var. Gr&aelig;cus (<i>Orphanidis</i>),
it produces seed abundantly, he concludes that it is a variety
of that species, which it very much resembles, but altered
and rendered sterile by cultivation. It is not now much
cultivated in England, but we have abundant authority
from Tusser, Gerard, Parkinson, Camden, and many other
writers, that it was largely cultivated before and after Shakespeare's
time, and that the quality of the English Saffron
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>[<a href="./images/271.png">271</a>]</span>was very superior.<a name="FNanchor_271:1_188" id="FNanchor_271:1_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_271:1_188" class="fnanchor">[271:1]</a> The importance of the crop is shown
by its giving its name to Saffron Walden in Essex,<a name="FNanchor_271:2_189" id="FNanchor_271:2_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_271:2_189" class="fnanchor">[271:2]</a> and to
Saffron Hill in London, which "was formerly a part of Ely
Gardens" (of which we shall hear again when we come to
speak of Strawberries), "and derives its name from the crops
of Saffron which it bore."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cunningham.</span> The plant has
in the same way given its name to Zaffarano, a village in
Sicily, near Mount Etna, and to Zafaranboly, "ville situ&eacute;e
pr&egrave;s Inobole en Anatolie, au sud-est de l'ancienne H&eacute;racl&eacute;e."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chappellier.</span>
The plant is largely cultivated in many
parts of Europe, but the chief centres of cultivation are in
the arrondissement of Pithiviers in France, and the province
of Arragon in Spain; and the chief consumers are the Germans.
It has also been largely cultivated in China for a
great many years, and the bulbs now imported from China
are found to be, in many points, superior to the European&mdash;"l'invasion
Tartare aurait port&eacute; le Safran en Chine, et
de leur c&ocirc;t&eacute; les crois&eacute;s l'auraient import&eacute; en Europe."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chappellier.</span></p>

<p>I need scarcely say that the parts of the plant that produce
the Saffron are the sweet-scented stigmata, the "Crocei
odores" of Virgil; but the use of Saffron has now so gone
out of fashion, that it may be well to say something of its
uses in the time of Shakespeare, as a medicine, a dye, and a
confection. On all three points its virtues were so many that
there is a complete literature on Crocus. I need not name
all the books on the subject, but the title page of one (a
duodecimo of nearly three hundred pages) may be quoted
as an example: "Crocologia seu curiosa Croci Regis Vegetabilium
enucleatio continens Illius etymologiam, differencias,
tempus quo viret et floret, culturam, collectionem,
usum mechanicum, Pharmaceuticum, Chemico medicum,
omnibus pene humani corporis partibus destinatum additis
diversis observationibus et questionibus Crocum concernentibus
ad normam et formam S. R. I. Academi&aelig; Natur&aelig;
curiosorum congesta a Dan: Ferdinando Hertodt, Phys. et
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>[<a href="./images/272.png">272</a>]</span>Med. Doc., &amp;c., &amp;c. Jen&aelig;. 1671." After this we may content
ourselves with Gerard's summary of its virtues: "The
moderate use of it is good for the head, and maketh sences
more quicke and lively, shaketh off heavy and drowsie sleep
and maketh a man mery." For its use in confections this
will suffice from the "Apparatus Plantarum" of Laurembergius,
1632: "In re familiari vix ullus est telluris
habitatus angulus ubi non sit Croci quotodiana usurpatio,
aspersi vel incocti cibis." And as to its uses as a dye, its
penetrating powers were proverbial, of which Luther's Sermons
will supply an instance: "As the Saffron bag that
hath bene ful of Saffron, or hath had Saffron in it, doth ever
after savour and smel of the swete Saffron that it contayneth;
so our blessed Ladye which conceived and bare Christe in
her wombe, dyd ever after resemble the maners and vertues
of that precious babe which she bare" ("Fourth Sermon,"
1548). One of the uses to which Saffron was applied in the
Middle Ages was for the manufacture of the beautiful gold
colour used in the illumination of missals, &amp;c., where the
actual gold was not used. This is the recipe from the work
of Theophilus in the eleventh century: "If ye wish to decorate
your work in some manner take tin pure and finely
scraped; melt it and wash it like gold, and apply it with the
same glue upon letters or other places which you wish to
ornament with gold or silver; and when you have polished
it with a tooth, take Saffron with which silk is colored,
moistening it with clear of egg without water, and when it
has stood a night, on the following day cover with a pencil
the places which you wish to gild, the rest holding the place
of silver" (Book i, c. 23, Hendrie's translation).</p>

<p>Though the chief fame of the Saffron Crocus is as a field
plant, yet it is also a very handsome flower; but it is a most
capricious one, which may account for the area of cultivation
being so limited. In some places it entirely refuses to
flower, as it does in my own garden, where I have cultivated
it for many years but never saw a flower, while in a
neighbour's garden, under apparently the very same conditions
of soil and climate, it flowers every autumn. But
if we cannot succeed with the Saffron Crocus, there are
many other Croci which were known in the time of Shakespeare,
and grown not "for any other use than in regard of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>[<a href="./images/273.png">273</a>]</span>their beautiful flowers of several varieties, as they have been
carefully sought out and preserved by divers to furnish a
garden of dainty curiosity." Gerard had in his garden only
six species; Parkinson had or described thirty-one different
sorts, and after his time new kinds were not so much sought
after till Dean Herbert collected and studied them. His
monograph of the Crocus, in 1847, contained the account
of forty-one species, besides many varieties. The latest
arrangement of the family by Mr. George Maw, of Broseley,
contains sixty-eight species, besides varieties; of these all
are not yet in cultivation, but every year sees some fresh
addition to the number, chiefly by the unwearied exertions
in finding them in their native habitats, and the liberal distribution
of them when found, of Mr. Maw, to whom all
the lovers of the Crocus are deeply indebted. And the
Croci are so beautiful that we cannot have too many of
them; they are, for the most part, perfectly hardy, though
some few require a little protection in winter; they are of
an infinite variety of colour, and some flower in the spring
and some in the autumn. Most of us call the Crocus a
spring flower, yet there are more autumnal than vernal
species, but it is as a spring flower that we most value it.
The common yellow Crocus is almost as much "the first-born
of the year's delight" as the Snowdrop. No one can
tell its native country, but it has been the brightest ornament
of our gardens, not only in spring, but even in winter,
for many years. It was probably first introduced during
Shakespeare's life. "It hath floures," says Gerard, "of a
most perfect shining yellow colour, seeming afar off to be a
hot glowing coal of fire. That pleasant plant was sent unto
me from Robinus, of Paris, that painful and most curious
searcher of simples." From that beginning perhaps it has
found its way into every garden, for it increases rapidly, is
very hardy, and its brightness commends it to all. It is the
"most gladsome of the early flowers. None gives more
glowing welcome to the season, or strikes on our first glance
with a ray of keener pleasure, when, with some bright morning's
warmth, the solitary golden fringes have kindled into
knots of thick-clustered yellow bloom on the borders of the
cottage garden. At a distance the eye is caught by that
glowing patch, its warm heart open to the sun, and dear to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a>[<a href="./images/274.png">274</a>]</span>the honey-gathering bees which hum around the chalices."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Forbes
Watson.</span></p>

<p>With this pretty picture I may well close the account of
the Crocus, but not because the subject is exhausted, for it
is very tempting to go much further, and to speak of the
beauties of the many species, and of the endless forms and
colours of the grand Dutch varieties; and whatever admiration
may be expressed for the common yellow Dutch Crocus,
the same I would also give to almost every member of this
lovely and cheerful family.</p>

<p>Being found only on rocks, the Samphire was naturally
associated with St. Peter, and so it was called in Italian
Herba di San Pietro, in English Sampire and Rock Sampier<a name="FNanchor_274:1_190" id="FNanchor_274:1_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_274:1_190" class="fnanchor">[274:1]</a>&mdash;in
other words, Samphire is simply a corruption of
Saint Peter. The plant grows round all the coasts of Great
Britain and Ireland, wherever there are suitable rocks on
which it can grow, and on all the coasts of Europe, except
the northern coasts; and it is a plant very easily recognized,
if not by its pale-green, fleshy leaves, yet certainly by its
taste, or its "smell delightful and pleasant." The leaves
form the pickle, "the pleasantest sauce, most familiar, and
best agreeing with man's body," but now much out of
fashion. In Shakespeare's time the gathering of Samphire
was a regular trade, and Steevens quotes from Smith's
"History of Waterford" to show the danger attending the
trade: "It is terrible to see how people gather it, hanging by
a rope several fathoms from the top of the impending rocks,
as it were in the air." In our own time the quantity required
could be easily got without much danger, for it grows in
places perfectly accessible in sufficient quantity for the
present requirements, for in some parts it grows away from
the cliffs, so that "the fields about Porth Gwylan, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>[<a href="./images/275.png">275</a>]</span>Carnarvonshire, are covered with it." It may even be grown
in the garden, especially in gardens near the sea, and makes
a pretty plant for rockwork.</p>

<p>There is a story connected with the Samphire which shows
how botanical knowledge, like all other knowledge, may be
of great service, even where least expected. Many years ago
a ship was wrecked on the Sussex coast, and a small party
were left on a rock not far from land. To their horror they
found the sea rising higher and higher, and threatening
before long to cover their place of refuge. Some of them
proposed to try and swim for land, and would have done so,
but just as they were preparing for it an officer saw a plant
of Samphire growing on the rock, and told them they might
stay and trust to that little plant that the sea would rise no
further, for that the Samphire, though always growing within
the spray of the sea, never grows where the sea could actually
touch it. They believed him and were saved.</p>

<p>Savory might be supposed to get its name as being a plant

<i>Saturcia</i>, through the Italian <i>Savoreggia</i>. It is a native of
the South of Europe, probably introduced into England by
the Romans, for it is mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon recipes
under the imported name of Savorie. It was a very favourite
plant in the old herb gardens, and both kinds, the Winter
and Summer Savory, were reckoned "among the farsing or

<p>Sedge is from the Anglo-Saxon Secg, and meant almost
any waterside plant. Thus we read of the Moor Secg, and
the Red Secg, and the Sea Holly (<i>Eryngium maritimum</i>) is
called the Holly Sedge. And so it was doubtless used by
Shakespeare. In our day Sedge is confined to the genus
Carex, a family growing in almost all parts of the world, and
containing about 1000 species, of which we have fifty-eight
in Great Britain; they are most graceful ornaments both
of our brooks and ditches; and some of them will make
handsome garden plants. One very handsome species&mdash;perhaps
the handsomest&mdash;is C. pendula, with long tassel-like
flower-spikes hanging down in a very beautiful form, which
is not uncommon as a wild plant, and can easily be grown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a>[<a href="./images/277.png">277</a>]</span>in the garden, and the flower-spikes will be found very handsome
additions to tall nosegays. There is another North
American species, C. Fraseri, which is a good plant for the
north side of a rock-work: it is a small plant, but the flower
is a spike of the purest white, and is very curious, and unlike
any other flower.</p>

<p>Even in the time of Shakespeare several attempts were
made to grow the Senna in England, but without success;
so that he probably only knew it as an important "purgative
drug." The Senna of commerce is made from the leaves of
Cassia lanceolata and Cassia Senna, both natives of Africa,
and so unfitted for open-air cultivation in England. The
Cassias are a large family, mostly with handsome yellow
flowers, some of which are very ornamental greenhouse
plants; and one from North America, Cassia Marylandica,
may be considered hardy in the South of England.</p>

<p>Except in this passage I can only find Speargrass mentioned
in Lupton's "Notable Things," and there without any description,
only as part of a medical recipe: "Whosoever is tormented
with sciatica or the hip gout, let them take an herb
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a>[<a href="./images/278.png">278</a>]</span>called Speargrass, and stamp it and lay a little thereof upon
the grief." The plant is not mentioned by Lyte, Gerard,
Parkinson, or the other old herbalists, and so it is somewhat
of a puzzle. Steevens quotes from an old play, "Victories
of Henry the Fifth": "Every day I went into the field, I
would take a straw and thrust it into my nose, and make my
nose bleed;" but a straw was never called Speargrass. Asparagus
was called Speerage, and the young shoots might
have been used for the purpose, but I have never heard of
such a use; Ranunculus flammula was called Spearwort,
from its lanceolate leaves, and so (according to Cockayne)
was Carex acuta, still called Spiesgrass in German. Mr.
Beisly suggests the Yarrow or Millfoil; and we know from
several authorities (Lyte, Hollybush, Gerard, Phillip, Cole,
Skinner, and Lindley) that the Yarrow was called Nosebleed;
but there seems no reason to suppose that it was
ever called Speargrass, or could have been called a Grass at
all, though the term Grass was often used in the most
general way. Dr. Prior suggests the Common Reed, which
is probable. I have been rather inclined to suppose it to
be one of the Horse-tails (Equiseta).<a name="FNanchor_278:1_193" id="FNanchor_278:1_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_278:1_193" class="fnanchor">[278:1]</a> They are very sharp
and spearlike, and their rough surfaces would soon draw
blood; and as a decoction of Horse-tail was a remedy for
stopping bleeding of the nose, I have thought it very probable
that such a supposed virtue could only have arisen
when remedies were sought for on the principle of "similia
similibus curantur;" so that a plant, which in one form
produced nose-bleeding, would, when otherwise administered,
be the natural remedy. But I now think that all
these suggested plants must give way in favour of the common
Couch-grass (<i>Triticum repens</i>). In the eastern counties,
this is still called Speargrass; and the sharp underground
stolons might easily draw blood, when the nose is tickled
with them. The old emigrants from the eastern counties
took the name with them to America, but applied it to a Poa
(Webster's "Dictionary," s.v. Speargrass).</p>

<p>The Bishop of Ely's garden in Holborn must have been
one of the chief gardens of England in the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries, for this is the third time it has been
brought under our notice. It was celebrated for its Roses
(<i>see</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#Roses">Rose</a></span>); it was so celebrated for its Saffron Crocuses
that part of it acquired the name which it still keeps, Saffron
Hill; and now we hear of its "good Strawberries;" while
the remembrance of "the ample garden," and of the handsome
Lord Chancellor to whom it was given when taken
from the bishopric, is still kept alive in its name of Hatton
Garden. How very good our forefathers' Strawberries were,
we have a strong proof in old Isaak Walton's happy words:
"Indeed, my good scholar, we may say of angling as Dr.
Boteler said of Strawberries: 'Doubtless God could have
made a better berry, but doubtless God never did;' and so,
if I might be judge, God never did make a more calm, quiet,
innocent recreation than angling." I doubt whether, with
our present experience of good Strawberries, we should join
in this high praise of the Strawberries of Shakespeare's or
Isaak Walton's day, for their varieties of Strawberry must
have been very limited in comparison to ours. Their chief
Strawberry was the Wild Strawberry brought straight from
the woods, and no doubt much improved in time by cultivation.

<p>Besides the wild one (<i>Fragaria vesca</i>), they had the Virginian
(<i>F. Virginiana</i>), a native of North America, and the
parent of our scarlets; but they do not seem to have had
the Hautbois (<i>F. elatior</i>), or the Chilian, or the Carolinas,
from which most of our good varieties have descended.</p>

<p>The Strawberry is among fruits what the Primrose and
Snowdrop are among flowers, the harbinger of other good
fruits to follow. It is the earliest of the summer fruits, and
there is no need to dwell on its delicate, sweet-scented
freshness, so acceptable to all; but it has also a charm in
autumn, known, however, but to few, and sometimes said to
be only discernible by few. Among "the flowers that yield
sweetest smell in the air," Lord Bacon reckoned Violets,
and "next to that is the Musk Rose, then the Strawberry
leaves dying, with a most excellent cordial smell." In Mrs.
Gaskell's pretty tale, "My Lady Ludlow," the dying Strawberry
leaves act an important part. "The great hereditary
faculty on which my lady piqued herself, and with reason,
for I never met with any other person who possessed it,
was the power she had of perceiving the delicious odour
arising from a bed of Strawberry leaves in the late autumn,
when the leaves were all fading and dying." The old lady
quotes Lord Bacon, and then says: "'Now the Hanburys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a>[<a href="./images/282.png">282</a>]</span>can always smell the excellent cordial odour, and very
delicious and refreshing it is. In the time of Queen Elizabeth
the great old families of England were a distinct race,
just as a cart-horse is one creature and very useful in its
place, and Childers or Eclipse is another creature, though
both are of the same species. So the old families have
gifts and powers of a different and higher class to what the
other orders have. My dear, remember that you try and
smell the scent of dying Strawberry leaves in this next
autumn, you have some of Ursula Hanbury's blood in you,
and that gives you a chance.' 'But when October came I
sniffed, and sniffed, and all to no purpose; and my lady,
who had watched the little experiment rather anxiously, had
to give me up as a hybrid'" ("Household Words," vol.
xviii.). On this I can only say in the words of an old writer,
"A rare and notable thing, if it be true, for I never proved
it, and never tried it; therefore, as it proves so, praise it."<a name="FNanchor_282:1_196" id="FNanchor_282:1_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_282:1_196" class="fnanchor">[282:1]</a>
Spenser also mentions the scent, but not of the leaves or

<p>There is a considerable interest connected with the name
of the plant, and much popular error. It is supposed to be
called Strawberry because the berries have straw laid under
them, or from an old custom of selling the wild ones strung
on straws.<a name="FNanchor_282:3_198" id="FNanchor_282:3_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_282:3_198" class="fnanchor">[282:3]</a> In Shakespeare's time straw was used for the
protection of Strawberries, but not in the present fashion&mdash;</p>

<p class="authorpoem"><span class="smcap">Tusser</span>, <i>December's Husbandry</i>.</p>

<p>But the name is much more ancient than either of these
customs. Strawberry in different forms, as Strea-berige,
Streaberie-wisan, Streaw-berige, Streaw-berian wisan, Streberilef,
Strabery, Strebere-wise, is its name in the old English
Vocabularies, while it appears first in its present form in a
Pictorial Vocabulary of the fifteenth century, "Hoc ffragrum,
A<sup>ce</sup> a Strawbery." What the word really means is pleasantly
told by a writer in Seeman's "Journal of Botany," 1869:
"How well this name indicates the now prevailing practice
of English gardeners laying straw under the berry in order
to bring it to perfection, and prevent it from touching the
earth, which without that precaution it naturally does, and
to which it owes its German <i>Erdbeere</i>, making us almost
forget that in this instance 'straw' has nothing to do with
the practice alluded to, but is an obsolete past-participle of
'to strew,' in allusion to the habit of the plant." This
obsolete word is preserved in our English Bibles, "gathering
where thou hast not strawed," "he strawed it upon the
water," "straw me with apples;" and in Shakespeare&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The bottom poison, and the top o'erstrawed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sweets.&mdash;<i>Venus and Adonis.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From another point of view there is almost as great a
mistake in the second half of the name, for in strict botanical
language the fruit of the Strawberry is not a berry; it is not
even "exactly a fruit, but is merely a fleshy receptacle bearing
fruit, the true fruit being the ripe carpels, which are
scattered over its surface in the form of minute grains looking
like seeds, for which they are usually mistaken, the seed
lying inside of the shell of the carpel." It is exactly the
contrary to the Raspberry, a fruit not named by Shakespeare,
though common in his time under the name of Rasps.
"When you gather the Raspberry you throw away the
receptacle under the name of core, never suspecting that it
is the very part you had just before been feasting upon in
the Strawberry. In the one case, the receptacle robs the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a>[<a href="./images/284.png">284</a>]</span>carpels of all their juice in order to become gorged and
bloated at their expense; in the other case, the carpels act in
the same selfish manner upon the receptacles."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lindley</span>,
<i>Ladies' Botany</i>.</p>

<p>Shakespeare's mention of the Strawberry and the Nettle
(No. <a href="#Nettle_2">2</a>) deserves a passing note. It was the common opinion
in his day that plants were affected by the neighbourhood of
other plants to such an extent that they imbibed each other's
virtues and faults. Thus sweet flowers were planted near
fruit trees, with the idea of improving the flavour of the
fruit, and evil-smelling trees, like the Elder, were carefully
cleared away from fruit trees, lest they should be tainted.
But the Strawberry was supposed to be an exception to the
rule, and was supposed to thrive in the midst of "evil
communications" without being corrupted. Preachers and
emblem-writers naturally seized upon this: "In tilling our
gardens we cannot but admire the fresh innocence and purity
of the Strawberry, because although it creeps along the
ground, and is continually crushed by serpents, lizards, and
other venomous reptiles, yet it does not imbibe the slightest
impression of poison, or the smallest malignant quality, a
true sign that it has no affinity with poison. And so it is
with human virtues," &amp;c. "In conversation take everything
peacefully, no matter what is said or done. In this manner
you may remain innocent amidst the hissing of serpents, and,
as a little Strawberry, you will not suffer contamination from
slimy things creeping near you."&mdash;<span class="smcap">St. Francis de Sales.</span></p>

<p>I need only add that the Strawberry need not be confined
to the kitchen garden, as there are some varieties which
make very good carpet plants, such as the variegated Strawberry,
which, however, is very capricious in its variegation;
the double Strawberry, which bears pretty white button-like
flowers; and the Fragaria lucida from California, which has
very bright shining leaves, and was, when first introduced,
supposed to be useful in crossing with other species; but I
have not heard that this has been successfully effected.</p>

<p>As a pure vegetable product, though manufactured, Sugar
cannot be passed over in an account of the plants of Shakespeare;
but it will not be necessary to say much about it.
Yet the history of the migrations of the Sugar-plant is sufficiently
interesting to call for a short notice.</p>

<p>Its original home seems to have been in the East Indies,
whence it was imported in very early times. It is probably
the "sweet cane" of the Bible; and among classical writers
it is named by Strabo, Lucan, Varro, Seneca, Dioscorides, and
Pliny. The plant is said to have been introduced into Europe
during the Crusades, and to have been cultivated in the
Morea, Rhodes, Malta, Sicily, and Spain.<a name="FNanchor_286:1_199" id="FNanchor_286:1_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_286:1_199" class="fnanchor">[286:1]</a> By the Spaniards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>[<a href="./images/287.png">287</a>]</span>it was taken first to Madeira and the Cape de Verd Islands,
and, very soon after the discovery of America, to the West
Indies. There it soon grew rapidly, and increased enormously,
and became a chief article of commerce, so that
though we now almost look upon it as entirely a New World
plant, it is in fact but a stranger there, that has found a
most congenial home.</p>

<p>In 1468 the price of Sugar was sixpence a pound, equal to
six shillings of our money,<a name="FNanchor_287:1_200" id="FNanchor_287:1_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_287:1_200" class="fnanchor">[287:1]</a> but in Shakespeare's time it must
have been very common,<a name="FNanchor_287:2_201" id="FNanchor_287:2_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_287:2_201" class="fnanchor">[287:2]</a> or it could not so largely have
worked its way into the common English language and proverbial
expressions; and it must also have been very cheap,
or it could not so entirely have superseded the use of honey,
which in earlier times was the only sweetening material.</p>

<p>Shakespeare may have seen the living plant, for it was
grown as a curiosity in his day, though Gerard could not
succeed with it: "Myself did plant some shootes thereof in
my garden, and some in Flanders did the like, but the
coldness of our clymate made an end of myne, and I think
the Flemmings will have the like profit of their labour."
But he bears testimony to the large use of Sugar in his day;
"of the juice of the reede is made the most pleasant and
profitable sweet called Sugar, whereof is made infinite confections,
sirupes, and such like, as also preserving and conserving
of sundrie fruits, herbes and flowers, as roses, violets, rosemary
flowers and such like."</p>

<p>In its botanical relationship, the Sycamore is closely allied
to the Maple, and was often called the Great Maple, and is
still so called in Scotland. It is not indigenous in Great
Britain, but it has long been naturalized among us, and has
taken so kindly to our soil and climate that it is one of our
commonest trees. It is one of the best of forest trees for
resisting wind; it "scorns to be biassed in its mode of growth
even by the prevailing wind, but shooting its branches with
equal boldness in every direction, shows no weatherside to
the storm, and may be broken, but never can be bended."-<i>Old
Mortality</i>, c. i.</p>

<p>The history of the name is curious. The Sycomore, or
Zicamine tree of the Bible and of Theophrastus and Dioscorides,
is the Fig-mulberry, a large handsome tree indigenous
in Africa and Syria, and largely planted, partly for the sake
of its fruit, and especially for the delicious shade it gives.
With this tree the early English writers were not acquainted,
but they found the name in the Bible, and applied it to any
shade-giving tree. Thus in &AElig;lfric's Vocabulary in the tenth
century it is given to the Aspen&mdash;"Sicomorus vel celsa
&aelig;ps." Chaucer gives the name to some hedge shrub, but
he probably used it for any thick shrub, without any very
special distinction&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0i">Plaine as a bord, of an height by and by."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>The Flower and the Leaf.</i></p>

<p>Our Sycamore would be very ill suited to make the sides
and roof of an arbour, but before the time of Shakespeare it
seems certain that the name was attached to our present
tree, and it is so called by Gerard and Parkinson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a>[<a href="./images/289.png">289</a>]</span>
The Sycamore is chiefly planted for its rapid growth rather
than for its beauty. It becomes a handsome tree when fully
grown, but as a young tree it is stiff and heavy, and at all
times it is so infested with honeydew as to make it unfit for
planting on lawns or near paths. It grows well in the north,
where other trees will not well flourish, and "we frequently
meet with the tree apart in the fields, or unawares in remote
localities amidst the Lammermuirs and the Cheviots, where
it is the surviving witness of the former existence of a hamlet
there. Hence to the botanical rambler it has a more melancholy
character than the Yew. It throws him back on past
days, when he who planted the tree was the owner of the
land and of the Hall, and whose name and race are forgotten
even by tradition.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And there is reasonable
pride in the ancestry when a grove of old gentlemanly Sycamores
still shadows the Hall."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Johnston.</span> But these old
Sycamores were not planted only for beauty: they were
sometimes planted for a very unpleasant use. "They were
used by the most powerful barons in the West of Scotland
for hanging their enemies and refractory vassals on, and for
this reason were called <i>dool</i> or grief trees. Of these there
are three yet standing, the most memorable being one near
the fine old castle of Cassilis, one of the seats of the Marquis
of Ailsa, on the banks of the River Doon. It was used
by the family of Kennedy, who were the most powerful
barons of the West of Scotland, for the purpose above mentioned."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Johns.</span></p>

<p>The wood of the Sycamore is useful for turning and a few
other purposes, but is not very durable. The sap, as in all
the Maples, is full of sugar, and the pollen is very curious;
"it appears globular in the microscope, but if it be touched
with anything moist, the globules burst open with four valves,
and then they appear in the form of a cross."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Miller.</span></p>

<p>Thistle is the old English name for a large family of
plants occurring chiefly in Europe and Asia, of which we
have fourteen species in Great Britain, arranged under the
botanical families of Carlina, Carduus, and Onopordon. It
is the recognized symbol of untidiness and carelessness,
being found not so much in barren ground as in good ground
not properly cared for. So good a proof of a rich soil does
the Thistle give, that a saying is attributed to a blind man
who was choosing a piece of land&mdash;"Take me to a Thistle;"
and Tusser says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Much wetnes, hog-rooting, and land out of hart
makes Thistles a number foorthwith to upstart.
If Thistles so growing proove lustie and long,
It signifieth land to be hartie and strong."</p></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>October's Husbandry</i> (13).</p>

<p>If the Thistles were not so common, and if we could get
rid of the associations they suggest, there are probably few
of our wild plants that we should more admire: they are
stately in their foliage and habit, and some of their flowers
are rich in colour, and the Thistledown, which carries the
seed far and wide, is very beautiful, and was once considered
useful as a sign of rain, for "if the down flyeth off
Coltsfoot, Dandelyon, or Thistles when there is no winde,
it is a signe of rain."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Coles</span>.</p>

<p>It had still another use in rustic divination&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Upon the various earth's embroidered gown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">There is a weed upon whose head grows down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Sow Thistle 'tis y'clept, whose downy wreath<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">If anyone can blow off at a breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">We deem her for a maid."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Browne's</span> <i>Brit. Past.</i>, i, 4.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But it is owing to these pretty Thistledowns that the plant
becomes a most undesirable neighbour, for they carry the
seed everywhere, and wherever it is carried, it soon vegetates,
and a fine crop of Thistles very quickly follows. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a>[<a href="./images/291.png">291</a>]</span>this way, if left to themselves, the Thistles will soon monopolize
a large extent of country, to the extinction of other
plants, as they have done in parts of the American prairies,
and as they did in Australia, till a most stringent Act of
Parliament was passed about twenty years ago, imposing
heavy penalties upon all who neglected to destroy the
Thistles on their land. For these reasons we cannot admit
the Thistle into the garden, at least not our native Thistles;
but there are some foreigners which may well be admitted.
There are the handsome yellow Thistles of the South of
Europe (<i>Scolymus</i>), which besides their beauty have a classical
interest. "Hesiod elegantly describing the time of
year, says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><ins class="greek" title="&ecirc;mos de skolymos t'anthei">&#7968;&#956;&#959;&#962; &#948;&#949; &#963;&#954;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#956;&#959;&#962; &#964;'&#945;&#957;&#952;&#949;&#953;</ins>,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>when the Scolymus flowers, <i>i.e.</i>, in hot weather or summer
("Op. et dies," 582). This plant crowned with its golden
flowers is abundant throughout Sicily."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hogg's</span> <i>Classical
Plants of Sicily</i>. There is the Fish-bone Thistle (<i>Cham&aelig;peuce
diacantha</i>) from Syria, a very handsome plant, and,
like most of the Thistles, a biennial; but if allowed to flower
and go to seed, it will produce plenty of seedlings for a
succession of years. And there is a grand scarlet Thistle
from Mexico, the Erythrolena conspicua ("Sweet," vol. ii.
p. 134), which must be almost the handsomest of the family,
and which was grown in England fifty years ago, but has
been long lost. There are many others that may deserve a
place as ornamental plants, but they find little favour, for
"they are only Thistles."</p>

<p>Any notice of the Thistle would be imperfect without
some mention of the Scotch Thistle. It is the one point in
the history of the plant that protects it from contempt. We
dare not despise a plant which is the honoured badge of our
neighbours and relations, the Scotch; which is ennobled as
the symbol of the Order of the Thistle, that claims to be the
most ancient of all our Orders of high honour; and which
defies you to insult it or despise it by its proud mottoes,
"Nemo me impune lacessit," "Ce que Dieu garde, est bien
gard&eacute;." What is the true Scotch Thistle even the Scotch
antiquarians cannot decide, and in the uncertainty it is
perhaps safest to say that no Thistle in particular can claim
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>[<a href="./images/292.png">292</a>]</span>the sole honour, but that it extends to every member of the
family that can be found in Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_292:1_202" id="FNanchor_292:1_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_292:1_202" class="fnanchor">[292:1]</a></p>

<p>Shakespeare has noticed the love of the bee for the
Thistle, and it seems that it is for other purposes than honey
gathering that he finds the Thistle useful. For "a beauty
has the Thistle, when every delicate hair arrests a dew-drop
on a showery April morning, and when the purple blossom
of a roadside Thistle turns its face to Heaven and welcomes
the wild bee, who lies close upon its flowerets on the approach
of some storm cloud until its shadow be past away.
For with unerring instinct the bee well knows that the darkness
is but for a moment, and that the sun will shine out
again ere long."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lady Wilkinson.</span></p>

<p>Thorns and Thistles are the typical emblems of desolation
and trouble, and so Shakespeare uses them; and had he
spoken of Thorns in this sense only, I should have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>[<a href="./images/294.png">294</a>]</span>doubtful as to admitting them among his other plants, but
as in some of the passages they stand for the Hawthorn tree
and the Rose bush, I could not pass them by altogether.
They might need no further comment beyond referring for
further information about them to <a href="#Hawthorn">Hawthorn</a>, <a href="#Brier">Briar</a>, <a href="#Roses">Rose</a>,
and <a href="#Bramble">Bramble</a>; but in speaking of the Bramble I mentioned
the curious legend which tells why the Bramble employs
itself in collecting wool from every stray sheep, and there is
another very curious instance in Blount's "Antient Tenures"
of a connection between Thorns and wool. The original
document is given in Latin, and is dated 39th Henry III.
It may be thus translated: "Peter de Baldwyn holds in
Combes, in the county of Surrey, by the service to go a wool
gathering for our Lady the Queen among the White Thorns,
and if he refuses to gather it he shall pay into the Treasury
of our Lord the King xxs. per annum." I should almost
suspect a false reading, as the editor is inclined to do, but
that many other services, equally curious and improbable,
may easily be found.</p>

<p>It is one of the most curious of the curiosities of English
plant names that the Wild Thyme&mdash;a plant so common and
so widely distributed, and that makes itself so easily known
by its fine aromatic, pungent scent, that it is almost impossible
to pass it by without notice&mdash;has yet no English
name, and seems never to have had one. Thyme is the
Anglicised form of the Greek and Latin <i>Thymum</i>, which
name it probably got from its use for incense in sacrifices,
while its other name of <i>serpyllum</i> pointed out its creeping
habit. I do not know when the word Thyme was first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>[<a href="./images/295.png">295</a>]</span>introduced into the English language, for it is another
curious point connected with the name, that <i>thymum</i> does
not occur in the old English vocabularies. We have in
&AElig;lfric's "Vocabulary," "Pollegia, hyl-wyrt," which may
perhaps be the Thyme, though it is generally supposed to be
the Pennyroyal; we have in a Vocabulary of thirteenth
century, "Epitime, epithimum, fordboh," which also may be
the Wild Thyme; we have in a Vocabulary of the fifteenth
century, "Hoc sirpillum, A<sup>ce</sup> petergrys;" and in a Pictorial
Vocabulary of the same date, "Hoc cirpillum, A<sup>ce</sup> a pellek"
(which word is probably a misprint, for in the "Promptorium
Parvulorum," c. 1440, it is "Peletyr, herbe, <i>serpillum
piretrum</i>"), both of which are almost certainly the Wild
Thyme; while in an Anglo-Saxon Vocabulary of the tenth or
eleventh century we have "serpulum, crop-leac," <i>i.e.</i>, the
Onion, which must certainly be a mistake of the compiler.
So that not even in its Latin form does the name occur,
except in the "Promptorium Parvulorum," where it is
"Tyme, herbe, <i>Tima</i>, <i>Timum</i>&mdash;Tyme, floure, <i>Timus</i>;" and
in the "Catholicon Anglicum," when it is "Tyme; <i>timum
epitimum; flos ejus est</i>." It is thus a puzzle how it can have
got naturalized among us, for in Shakespeare's time it was
completely naturalized.</p>

<p>I have already quoted Lord Bacon's account of it under
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Burnet">Burnet</a></span>, but I must quote it again here: "Those flowers
which perfume the air most delightfully, not passed by as
the rest, but being trodden upon and crushed, are three&mdash;that
is Burnet, Wild Thyme, and Water mints; therefore
you are to set whole alleys of them, to have the pleasure
when you walk or tread;" and again in his pleasant description
of the heath or wild garden, which he would have in
every "prince-like garden," and "framed as much as may
be to a natural wildness," he says, "I like also little heaps,
in the nature of mole-hills (such as are in wild heaths) to be
set some with Wild Thyme, some with Pinks, some with
Germander." Yet the name may have been used sometimes
as a general name for any wild, strong-scented plant. It
can only be in this sense that Milton used it&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">"Thee, shepherd! thee the woods and desert caves,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a>[<a href="./images/296.png">296</a>]</span>
for certainly a desert cave is almost the last place in which
we should look for the true Wild Thyme.</p>

<p>It is as a bee-plant especially that the Thyme has always
been celebrated. Spenser speaks of it as "the bees alluring
Tyme," and Ovid says of it, speaking of Chloris or Flora&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mella meum munus; volucres ego mella daturos<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Ad violam et cytisos, et Thyma cana voco."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Fasti</i>, v.</p>

<p>so that the Thyme became proverbial as the symbol of
sweetness. It was the highest compliment that the shepherd
could pay to his mistress&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nerine Galatea, Thymo mihi dulcior Hybl&aelig;."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><span class="smcap">Virgil</span>, <i>Ecl.</i> vii.</p>

<p>And it was because of its wild Thyme that Mount Hymettus
became so celebrated for its honey&mdash;"Mella Thymi redolentia
flore" (Ovid). "Thyme, for the time it lasteth,
yeeldeth most and best honni, and therefore in old time was
accounted chief (Thymus aptissimus ad mellificum&mdash;Pastus
gratissimus apibus Thymum est&mdash;Plinii, 'His. Nat.')</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Dum thymo pascentur apes, dum rore cicad&aelig;.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><span class="smcap">Virgil</span>, <i>Georg.</i></p>

<p>Hymettus in Greece and Hybla in Sicily were so famous for
Bees and Honni, because there grew such store of Tyme;
propter hoc Siculum mel fert palmam, quod ibi Thymum
bonum et frequens est."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Varro</span>, <i>The Feminine Monarchie</i>,
1634.</p>

<p>The Wild Thyme can scarcely be considered a garden
plant, except in its variegated and golden varieties, which
are very handsome, but if it should ever come naturally in
the turf, it should be welcomed and cherished for its sweet
scent. The garden Thyme (<i>T. vulgaris</i>) must of course be
in every herb garden; and there are a few species which
make good plants for the rockwork, such as T. lanceolatus
from Greece, a very low-growing shrub, with narrow, pointed
leaves; T. carnosus, which makes a pretty little shrub, and
others; while the Corsican Thyme (<i>Mentha Requieni</i>) is
perhaps the lowest and closest-growing of all herbs, making
a dark-green covering to the soil, and having a very strong
scent, though more resembling Peppermint than Thyme.</p>

<p>The Turnips of Shakespeare's time were like ours, and
probably as good, though their cultivation seems to have
been chiefly confined to gardens. It is not very certain
whether the cultivated Turnip is the wild Turnip improved
in England by cultivation, or whether we are indebted for it
to the Romans, and that the wild one is only the degenerate
form of the cultivated plant; for though the wild Turnip is
admitted into the English flora, yet its right to the admission
is very doubtful. But if we did not get the vegetable from
the Romans we got its name. The old name for it was <i>n&oelig;p</i>,
<i>nep</i>, or <i>neps</i>, which was only the English form of the Latin
<i>napus</i>, while Turnip is the corruption of <i>terr&aelig; napus</i>, but
when the first syllable was added I do not know. There is
a curious perversion in the name, for our Turnip is botanically
Brassica rapa, while the Rape is Brassica napus, so that
the English and Latin have changed places, the Napus
becoming a Rape and the Rapa a Nep.</p>

<p>The present large field cultivation of Turnips is of comparatively
a modern date, though the field Turnip and
garden Turnip are only varieties of the same species, while
there are also many varieties both of the field and garden
Turnip. "One field proclaims the Scotch variety, while
the bluer cast tells its hardy Swedish origin; the tankard
proclaims a deep soil, and the lover of boiled mutton,
rejoicing, sees the yellower tint of the Dutch or Stone
Turnip, which he desires to meet with again in the market."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Phillips.</span></p>

<p>It is not very easy to speak of the moral qualities of
Turnips, or to make them the symbols of much virtue, yet
Gwillim did so: "He beareth sable, a Turnip proper, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a>[<a href="./images/298.png">298</a>]</span>chief or gutte de Larmes. This is a wholesome root, and
yieldeth great relief to the poor, and prospereth best in a
hot sandy ground, and may signifie a person of good disposition,
whose vertuous demeanour flourisheth most prosperously,
even in that soil, where the searching heat of envy
most aboundeth. This differeth much in nature from that
whereof it is said, 'And that there should not be among
you any root that bringeth forth gall and wormwood.'"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gwillim's</span>

<p>The cultivated Vetch (<i>Vicia sativa</i>) is probably not a
British plant, and it is not very certain to what country it
rightly belongs; but it was very probably introduced into
England by the Romans as an excellent and easily-grown
fodder-plant. There are several Vetches that are true British
plants, and they are among the most beautiful ornaments of
our lanes and hedges. Two especially deserve to take a place
in the garden for their beauty; but they require watching, or
they will scramble into parts where their presence is not
desirable; these are V. cracca and V. sylvatica. V. cracca has
a very bright pure blue flower, and may be allowed to scramble
over low bushes; V. sylvatica is a tall climber, and may be
seen in copses and high hedges climbing to the tops of the
Hazels and other tall bushes. It is one of the most graceful
of our British plants, and perhaps quite the most graceful of
our climbers; it bears an abundance of flowers, which are
pure white streaked and spotted with pale blue; it is not a
very common plant, but I have often seen it in Gloucestershire
and Somersetshire, and wherever it is found it is generally
in abundance.</p>

<p>The other name for the Vetch is Tares, which is, no doubt,
an old English word that has never been satisfactorily
explained. The word has an interest from its biblical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a>[<a href="./images/299.png">299</a>]</span>associations, though modern scholars decide that the Zizania
is wrongly translated Tares, and that it is rather a bastard
Wheat or Darnel.</p>

<p>Besides these different references to the Grape Vine, some
of its various products are mentioned, as Raisins, wine, aquavit&aelig;
or brandy, claret (the "thin potations" forsworn by
Falstaff), sherris-sack or sherry, and malmsey. But none of
these passages gives us much insight into the culture of the
Vine in England, the whole history of which is curious and
interesting.</p>

<p>The Vine is not even a native of Europe, but of the East,
whence it was very early introduced into Europe; so early,
indeed, that it has recently been found "fossil in a tufaceous
deposit in the South of France."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Darwin.</span> It was no doubt
brought into England by the Romans. Tacitus, describing
England in the first century after Christ, says expressly that
the Vine did not, and, as he evidently thought, could not
grow there. "Solum, pr&aelig;ter oleam vitemque et c&aelig;tera
calidioribus terris oriri sueta, patiens frugum, f&aelig;cundum."
Yet Bede, writing in the eighth century, describes England
as "opima frugibus atque arboribus insula, et alendis apta
pecoribus et jumentis Vineas etiam quibusdam in locis
germinans."<a name="FNanchor_301:1_203" id="FNanchor_301:1_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_301:1_203" class="fnanchor">[301:1]</a></p>

<p>From that time till the time of Shakespeare there is
abundant proof not only of the growth of the Vine as we
now grow it in gardens, but in large Vineyards. In Anglo-Saxon
times "a Vineyard" is not unfrequently mentioned
in various documents. "Edgar gives the Vineyard situated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a>[<a href="./images/302.png">302</a>]</span>at Wecet, with the Vine-dressers."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Turner's</span> <i>Anglo-Saxons</i>.
"'Domesday Book' contained thirty-eight entries of valuable
Vineyards; one in Essex consisted of six acres, and yielded
twenty hogsheads of wine in a good year. There was another
of the same extent at Ware."&mdash;<span class="smcap">H. Evershed</span>, in <i>Gardener's
Chronicle</i>. So in the Norman times, "Giraldus Cambrensis,
speaking of the Castle of Manorbeer (his birthplace), near
Pembroke, said that it had under its walls, besides a fishpond,
a beautiful garden, enclosed on one side by a Vineyard
and on the other by a wood, remarkable for the projection
of its rocks and the height of its Hazel trees. In the twelfth
century Vineyards were not uncommon in England."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wright.</span>
Neckam, writing in that century, refers to the
usefulness of the Vine when trained against the wall-front:
"Pampinus latitudine su&acirc; excipit &aelig;ris insultus, cum res ita
desiderat, et fenestra clementiam caloris solaris admittat."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hudson
Turner.</span></p>

<p>In the time of Shakespeare I suppose that most of the
Vines in England were grown in Vineyards of more or less
extent, trained to poles. These formed the "pole-clipt
Vineyards" of No. <a href="#Vine_21">21</a>, and are thus described by Gerard:
"The Vine is held up with poles and frames of wood, and
by that means it spreadeth all about and climbeth aloft; it
joyneth itselfe unto trees, or whatsoever standeth next unto
it"&mdash;in other words, the Vine was then chiefly grown as a
standard in the open ground.</p>

<p>There are numberless notices in the records and chronicles
of extensive vineyards in England, which it is needless to
quote; but it is worth noticing that the memory of these
Vineyards remains not only in the chronicles and in the
treatises which teach of Vine-culture, but also in the names
of streets, &amp;c., which are occasionally met with. There is
"Vineyard Holm," in the Hampshire Downs, and many
other places in Hampshire; the "Vineyard Hills," at
Godalming; the "Vines," at Rochester and Sevenoaks;
the "Vineyards," at Bath and Ludlow; the "Vine Fields,"
near the Abbey at Bury St. Edmunds;<a name="FNanchor_302:1_204" id="FNanchor_302:1_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_302:1_204" class="fnanchor">[302:1]</a> the "Vineyard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a>[<a href="./images/303.png">303</a>]</span>Walk" in Clerkenwell; and "near Basingstoke the 'Vine'
or 'Vine House,' in a richly wooded spot, where, as is
said, the Romans grew the first Vine in Britain, the memory
of which now only survives in the Vine Hounds;"<a name="FNanchor_303:1_205" id="FNanchor_303:1_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_303:1_205" class="fnanchor">[303:1]</a> and
probably a closer search among the names of fields in other
parts would bring to light many similar instances.<a name="FNanchor_303:2_206" id="FNanchor_303:2_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_303:2_206" class="fnanchor">[303:2]</a></p>

<p>Among the English Vineyards those of Gloucestershire
stood pre-eminent. William of Malmesbury, writing of
Gloucestershire in the twelfth century, says: "This county
is planted thicker with Vineyards than any other in England,
more plentiful in crops, and more pleasant in flavour. For
the wines do not offend the mouth with sharpness, since they
do not yield to the French in sweetness" ("De Gestis Pontif.,"
book iv.) Of these Vineyards the tradition still remains in
the county. The Cotswold Hills are in many places curiously
marked with a succession of steps or narrow terraces, called
"litchets" or "lynches;" these are traditionally the sites of
the old Vineyards, but the tradition cannot be fully depended
on, and the formation of the terraces has been variously
accounted for. By some they are supposed to be natural
formations, but wherever I have seen them they appear to
me too regular and artificial; nor, as far as I am aware,
does the oolite, on which formation these terraces mostly
occur, take the form of a succession of narrow terraces. It
seems certain that the ground was artificially formed into
these terraces with very little labour, and that they were
utilized for some special cultivation, and as likely for Vines
as for any other.<a name="FNanchor_303:3_207" id="FNanchor_303:3_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_303:3_207" class="fnanchor">[303:3]</a> It is also certain that as the Gloucestershire
Vineyards were among the most ancient and the best
in England, so they held their ground till within a very
recent period. I cannot find the exact date, but some time
during the last century there is "satisfactory testimony of
the full success of a plantation in Cromhall Park, from
which ten hogsheads of wine were made in the year. The
Vine plantation was discontinued or destroyed in consequence
of a dispute with the Rector on a claim of the tythes."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rudge's</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a>[<a href="./images/304.png">304</a>]</span><i>History of Gloucestershire</i>. This, however, is not
quite the latest notice I have met with, for Phillips, writing
in 1820, says: "There are several flourishing Vineyards at
this time in Somersetshire; the late Sir William Basset, in
that county, annually made some hogsheads of wine, which
was palatable and well-bodied. The idea that we cannot
make good wine from our own Grapes is erroneous; I have
tasted it quite equal to the Grave wines, and in some instances,
when kept for eight or ten years, it has been drunk
as hock by the nicest judges."&mdash;<i>Pomarium Britannicum.</i>
It would have been more satisfactory if Mr. Phillips had told
us the exact locality of any of these "flourishing Vineyards,"
for I can nowhere else find any account of them, except that
in a map of five miles round Bath in 1801 a Vineyard is
marked at Claverton, formerly in the possession of the
Bassets, and the Vines are distinctly shown.<a name="FNanchor_304:1_208" id="FNanchor_304:1_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_304:1_208" class="fnanchor">[304:1]</a> At present the
experiment is again being tried by the Marquis of Bute, at
Castle Coch, near Cardiff, to establish a Vineyard, not to
produce fruit for the market, but to produce wine; and as
both soil and climate seem very suitable, there can be little
doubt that wine will be produced of a very fair character.
Whether it will be a commercial success is more doubtful,
but probably that is not of much consequence.</p>

<p>I have dwelt at some length on the subject of the English
Vineyards, because the cultivation of the Vine in Vineyards,
like the cultivation of the Saffron, is a curious instance of an
industry foreign to the soil introduced, and apparently for
many years successful,<a name="FNanchor_304:2_209" id="FNanchor_304:2_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_304:2_209" class="fnanchor">[304:2]</a> and then entirely, or almost, given
up. The reasons for the cessation of the English Vineyards
are not far to seek. Some have attributed it to a change in
the seasons, and have supposed that our summers were
formerly hotter than they are now, bringing as a proof the
Vineyards and English-made wine of other days. This was
Parkinson's idea. "Our yeares in these times do not fall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a>[<a href="./images/305.png">305</a>]</span>out to be so kindly and hot to ripen the Grape to make any
good wine as formerly they have done." But this is a mere
assertion, and I believe it not to be true. I have little doubt
that quite as good wine could now be made in England as
ever was made, and wine is still made every year in many
old-fashioned farmhouses. But foreign wines can now be
produced much better and much cheaper, and that has
caused the cessation of the English Vineyards. It is true
that French and Spanish wines were introduced into England
very early, but it must have been in limited quantities,
and at a high price. When the quantities increased and the
price was lowered, it was well to give up the cultivation of
the Vine for some more certain crop better suited to the
soil and the climate, for it must always have been a capricious
and uncertain crop. Hakluyt was one who was very anxious
that England should supply herself with all the necessaries
of life without dependence on foreign countries, yet, writing
in Shakespeare's time, he says: "It is sayd that since we
traded to Zante, that the plant that beareth the Coren is also
broughte into this realme from thence, and although it bring
not fruit to perfection, yet it may serve for pleasure, and for
some use, like as our Vines doe which we cannot well spare,
although the climat so colde will not permit us to have good
wines of them" ("Voiages, &amp;c.," vol. ii. p. 166). Parkinson
says to the same effect: "Many have adventured to make
Vineyards in England, not only in these later days but in
ancient times, as may well witness the sundry places in this
land, entituled by the name of Vineyards, and I have read
that many monasteries in this kingdom having Vineyards had
as much wine made therefrom as sufficed their convents
year by year, but long since they have been destroyed, and
the knowledge how to order a Vineyard is also utterly
perished with them. For although divers both nobles and
gentlemen have in these later times endeavoured to plant
and make Vineyards, and to that purpose have caused
Frenchmen, being skilfull in keeping and dressing Vines, to
be brought over to perform it, yet either their skill faileth
them or their Vines were not good, or (the most likely) the
soil was not fitting, for they could never make any wine that
was worth the drinking, being so small and heartlesse, that
they soon gave over their practise."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a>[<a href="./images/306.png">306</a>]</span>
There is no need to say anything of the modern culture
of the Vine, or its many excellent varieties. Even in
Virgil's time the varieties cultivated were so many that he
said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sed neque quam mult&aelig; species, nec nomina qu&aelig; sint<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Est numerus; neque enim numero comprendere refert;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Quem qui scire velit, Lybici velit &aelig;quoris idem<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Discere quam mult&aelig; Zephyro turbentur aren&aelig;;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Aut ubi navigiis violentior incidit Eurus<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Nosse quot Ionii veniant ad littora fluctus."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Georgica</i>, ii, 103.</p>

<p>And now the number must far exceed those of Virgil's
time. "The cultivated varieties are extremely numerous;
Count Odart says that he will not deny that there may
exist throughout the world 700 or 800, perhaps even 1,000
varieties; but not a third of these have any value."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Darwin.</span>
These are the Grapes that are grown in our hothouses;
some also of a fine quality are produced in favourable years
out-of-doors. There are also a few which are grown as
ornamental shrubs. The Parsley-leaved Vine (<i>Vitis laciniosa</i>)
is one that has been grown in England, certainly since the
time of Shakespeare, for its pretty foliage, its fruit being
small and few; but it makes a pretty covering to a wall or
trellis. The small Variegated Vine (<i>Vitis</i> or <i>Cissus heterophyllus
variegatus</i>) is another very pretty Vine, forming a
small bush that may be either trained to a wall or grown as
a low rockwork bush; it bears a few Grapes of no value,
and is perfectly hardy. Besides these there are several
North American species, which have handsome foliage, and
are very hardy, of which the Vitis riparia or Vigne des
Battures is a desirable tree, as "the flowers have an exquisitely
fine smell, somewhat resembling that of Mignonnette."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Don.</span>
I mention this particularly, because in all
the old authors great stress is laid on the sweetness of the
Vine in all its parts, a point of excellence in it which is now
generally overlooked. Lord Bacon reckons "Vine flowers"
among the "things of beauty in season" in May and June,
and reckons among the most sweet-scented flowers, next to
Musk Roses and Strawberry leaves dying, "the flower of
the Vines; it is a little dust, like the dust of a bent, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a>[<a href="./images/307.png">307</a>]</span>grows among the duster in the first coming forth." And
Chaucer says: "Scorners faren like the foul toode, that
may noughte endure the soote smel of the Vine roote when
it flourisheth."&mdash;<i>The Persones Tale.</i></p>

<p>Nor must we dismiss the Vine without a few words respecting
its sacred associations, for it is very much owing to
these associations that it has been so endeared to our forefathers
and ourselves. Having its native home in the East,
it enters largely into the history and imagery of the Bible.
There is no plant so often mentioned in the Bible, and
always with honour, till the honour culminates in the great
similitude, in which our Lord chose the Vine as the one
only plant to which He condescended to compare Himself&mdash;"I
am the true Vine!" No wonder that a plant so honoured
should ever have been the symbol of joy and plenty, of
national peace and domestic happiness.</p>

<p>There are about a hundred different species of Violets, of
which there are five species in England, and a few sub-species.
One of these is the Viola tricolor, from which is
descended the Pansy, or Love-in-Idleness (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#Pansies">Pansy</a></span>). But
in all the passages in which Shakespeare names the Violet,
he alludes to the purple sweet-scented Violet, of which he
was evidently very fond, and which is said to be very
abundant in the neighbourhood of Stratford-on-Avon.
For all the eighteen passages tell of some point of beauty
or sweetness that attracted him. And so it is with all the
poets from Chaucer downwards&mdash;the Violet is noticed by
all, and by all with affectation. I need only mention
two of the greatest. Milton gave the Violet a chief place
in the beauties of the "Blissful Bower" of our first parents
in Paradise&mdash;</p>

<p>Yet favourite though it ever has been, it has no English
name. Violet is the diminutive form of the Latin Viola,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>[<a href="./images/310.png">310</a>]</span>which again is the Latin form of the Greek <ins class="greek" title="ion">&#7988;&#959;&#957;</ins>. In the old
Vocabularies Viola frequently occurs, and with the following
various translations:&mdash;"Ban-wyrt," <i>i.e.</i>, Bone-wort (eleventh
century Vocabulary); "Cl&oelig;fre," <i>i.e.</i>, Clover (eleventh
century Vocabulary); "Viol&eacute;, Appel-leaf" (thirteenth
century Vocabulary);<a name="FNanchor_310:1_210" id="FNanchor_310:1_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_310:1_210" class="fnanchor">[310:1]</a> "Wyolet" (fourteenth century
Vocabulary); "Vyolytte" (fifteenth century Nominale);
"Violetta, A<sup>ce</sup>, a Violet" (fifteenth century Pictorial
Vocabulary); and "Viola Cleafre, Ban-vyrt" (Durham
Glossary). It is also mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon translation
of the Herbarium of Apuleius in the tenth century
as "the Herb Viola purpurea; (1) for new wounds and eke
for old; (2) for hardness of the maw" (Cockayne's translation).
In this last example it is most probable that our
sweet-scented Violet is the plant meant, but in some of the
other cases it is quite certain that some other plant is
meant, and perhaps in all. For Violet was a name given
very loosely to many plants, so that Laurembergius says:
"Vox Viol&aelig; distinctissimis floribus communis est. Videntur
mihi antiqui suaveolentes quosque flores generatim Violas
appellasse, cujuscunque etiam forent generis quasi vi oleant."&mdash;<i>Apparat.
Plant.</i>, 1632. This confusion seems to have
arisen in a very simple way. Theophrastus described the
Leucojum, which was either the Snowdrop or the spring
Snowflake, as the earliest-flowering plant; Pliny literally
translated Leucojum into Alba Viola. All the earlier writers
on natural history were in the habit of taking Pliny for
their guide, and so they translated his Viola by any early-flowering
plant that most took their fancy. Even as late as
1693, Samuel Gilbert, in "The Florists' Vade Mecum,"
under the head of Violets, only describes "the lesser early
bulbous Violet, a common flower yet not to be wasted,
because when none other appears that does, though in the
snow, whence called Snowflower or Snowdrop;" and I
think that even later instances may be found.</p>

<p>When I say that there is no genuine English name for the
Violet, I ought, perhaps, to mention that one name has been
attributed to it, but I do not think that it is more than a
clever guess. "The commentators on Shakespeare have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>[<a href="./images/311.png">311</a>]</span>been much puzzled by the epithet 'happy lowlie down,'
applied to the man of humble station in "Henry IV.," and
have proposed to read 'lowly clown,' or to divide the phrase
into 'low lie down,' but the following lines from Browne
clearly prove 'lowly down' to be the correct term, for he
uses it in precisely the same sense&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The humble Violet that lowly down<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Salutes the gay nymphs as they trimly pass.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Poet's Pleasaunce.</i>"</p>

<p>This may prove that Browne called the Violet a Lowly-down,
but it certainly does not prove that name to have
been a common name for the Violet. It was, however,
the character of lowliness combined with sweetness that
gave the charm to the Violet in the eyes of the emblem
writers: it was for them the readiest symbol of the meekness
of humility. "Humilitas dat gratiam" is the motto that
Camerarius places over a clump of Violets. "A true widow
is, in the church, as a little March Violet shedding around
an exquisite perfume by the fragrance of her devotion, and
always hidden under the ample leaves of her lowliness, and
by her subdued colouring showing the spirit of her mortification,
she seeks untrodden and solitary places," &amp;c.&mdash;<span class="smcap">St.
Francis de Sales.</span> And the poets could nowhere find a
fitter similitude for a modest maiden than</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A Violet by a mossy stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Half hidden from the eye."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Violets, like Primroses, must always have had their joyful
associations as coming to tell that the winter is passing away
and brighter days are near, for they are among</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"The first to rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smile beneath spring's wakening skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i3h">The courier of a band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of coming flowers."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Yet it is curious to note how, like Primroses, they have
been ever associated with death, especially with the death of
the young. I suppose these ideas must have arisen from a
sort of pity for flowers that were only allowed to see the
opening year, and were cut off before the full beauty of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a>[<a href="./images/312.png">312</a>]</span>summer had come. This was prettily expressed by H.
Vaughan, the Silurist:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4h">"So violets, so doth the primrose fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once the spring's pride and its funeral,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such early sweets get off in their still prime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stay not here to wear the foil of time;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While coarser flowers, which none would miss, if past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To scorching summers and cold winters last."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Daphnis</i>, 1678.</p>

<p>It was from this association that they were looked on as apt
emblems of those who enjoyed the bright springtide of life
and no more. This feeling was constantly expressed, and
from very ancient times. We find it in some pretty lines
by Prudentius&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nos tecta fovebimus ossa<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Violis et fronde frequente,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Titulumque et frigida saxa<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Liquido spargemus odore."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Shakespeare expresses the same feeling in the collection of
"purple Violets and Marigolds" which Marina carries to
hang "as a carpet on the grave" (No. <a href="#Violet_14">14</a>), and again in
Laertes' wish that Violets may spring from the grave of
Ophelia (No. <a href="#Violet_8">8</a>), on which Steevens very aptly quotes from
Persius Satires&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"e tumulo fortunataque favill&acirc;.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nascentur Viol&aelig;."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the same spirit Milton, gathering for the grave of Lycidas&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Every flower that sad embroidery wears,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>gathers among others "the glowing Violet;" and the same
thought is repeated by many other writers.</p>

<p>There is a remarkable botanical curiosity in the structure
of the Violet which is worth notice: it produces flowers both
in spring and autumn, but the flowers are very different. In
spring they are fully formed and sweet-scented, but they are
mostly barren and produce no seed, while in autumn they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a>[<a href="./images/313.png">313</a>]</span>very small, they have no petals and, I believe, no scent, but
they produce abundance of seed.<a name="FNanchor_313:1_211" id="FNanchor_313:1_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_313:1_211" class="fnanchor">[313:1]</a></p>

<p>I need say nothing to recommend the Violet in all its
varieties as a garden plant. As a useful medicinal plant it
was formerly in high repute&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Vyolet an erbe cowth<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Stockholm MS.</i></p>

<p>and it still holds a place in the Pharmacop&oelig;ia, while the
chemist finds the pretty flowers one of the most delicate tests
for detecting the presence of acids and alkalies; but as to
the many other virtues of the Violet I cannot do better than
quote Gerard's pleasant and quaint words: "The Blacke
or Purple Violets, or March Violets of the garden, have a
great prerogative above others, not only because the minde
conceiveth a certain pleasure and recreation by smelling and
handling of those most odoriferous flowres, but also for that
very many by these Violets receive ornament and comely
grace; for there be made of them garlands for the head,
nosegaies, and poesies, which are delightfull to looke on and
pleasant to smell to, speaking nothing of their appropriate
vertues; yea, gardens themselves receive by these the greatest
ornament of all chiefest beautie and most gallant grace, and
the recreation of the minde which is taken thereby cannot
but be very good and honest; for they admonish and stir
up a man to that which is comely and honest, for flowres
through their beautie, variety of colour, and exquisite forme,
do bring to a liberall and greatte many minde the remembrance
of honestie, comelinesse, and all kindes of vertues.
For it would be an unseemely and filthie thing (as a certain
wise man saith) for him that doth looke upon and handle
faire and beautifull things, and who frequenteth and is conversant
in faire and beautifull places, to have his minde not
faire but filthie and deformed." With these brave words of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a>[<a href="./images/314.png">314</a>]</span>the old gardener I might well close my account of this
favourite flower, but I must add George Herbert's lines
penned in the same spirit&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Farewell, dear flowers, sweetly your time ye spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Fit, while ye lived, for smell or ornament,<br /></span>

<p>The Walnut is a native of Persia and China, and its foreign
origin is told in all its names. The Greeks called it Persicon,
<i>i.e.</i>, the Persian tree, and Basilikon, <i>i.e.</i>, the Royal tree; the
Latins gave it a still higher rank, naming it Juglans, <i>i.e.</i>,
Jove's Nut. "H&aelig;c glans, optima et maxima, ab Jove et
glande juglans appellata est."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Varro.</span> The English names
tell the same story. It was first simply called Nut, as the
Nut <i>par excellence</i>. "<i>Juglantis vel nux</i>, knutu."&mdash;<span class="smcap">&AElig;lfric's</span>
<i>Vocabulary</i>. But in the fourteenth century it had obtained
the name of "Ban-nut," from its hardness. So it is named
in a metrical Vocabulary of the fourteenth century&mdash;</p>

<p>and this name it still holds in the West of England. But at
the same time it had also acquired the name of Walnut.
"<i>Hec avelana</i>, A<sup>ce</sup> Walnot-tree" (Vocabulary fourteenth
century). "<i>Hec avelana</i>, a Walnutte and the Nutte"
(Nominate fifteenth century). This name is commonly
supposed to have reference to the hard shell, but it only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a>[<a href="./images/315.png">315</a>]</span>means that the nut is of foreign origin. "Wal" is another
form of Walshe or Welch, and so Lyte says that the tree is
called "in English the Walnut and Walshe Nut tree." "The
word Welsh (<i>wilisc</i>, <i>woelisc</i>) meant simply a foreigner, one
who was not of Teutonic race, and was (by the Saxons)
applied especially to nations using the Latin language. In
the Middle Ages the French language, and in fact all those
derived from Latin, and called on that account <i>lingu&aelig;
Roman&aelig;</i>, were called in German <i>Welsch</i>. France was called
by the medi&aelig;val German writers <i>daz Welsche lant</i>, and when
they wished to express 'in the whole world,' they said, <i>in
allen Welschen und in Tiutschen richen</i>, 'in all Welsh and
Teutonic kingdoms.' In modern German the name <i>W&auml;lsch</i> is
used more especially for Italian."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wright's</span> <i>Celt, Roman,
and Saxon</i>.<a name="FNanchor_315:1_212" id="FNanchor_315:1_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_315:1_212" class="fnanchor">[315:1]</a> This will at once explain that Walnut simply
means the foreign or non-English Nut.</p>

<p>It must have been a well-established and common tree in
Shakespeare's time, for all the writers of his day speak of it
as a high and large tree, and I should think it very likely
that Walnut trees were even more extensively planted in his
day than in our own. There are many noble specimens to be
seen in different parts of England, especially in the chalk
districts, for "it delights," says Evelyn, "in a dry, sound,
rich land, especially if it incline to a feeding chalk or marl;
and where it may be protected from the cold (though it
affects cold rather than extreme heat), as in great pits,
valleys, and highway sides; also in stony ground, if loamy,
and on hills, especially chalky; likewise in cornfields." The
grand specimens that may be seen in the sheltered villages
lying under the chalk downs of Wiltshire and Berkshire bear
witness to the truth of Evelyn's remarks. But the finest
English specimens can bear no comparison with the size of
the Walnut trees in warmer countries, and especially where
they are indigenous. There they "sometimes attain prodigious
size and great age. An Italian architect mentions
having seen at St. Nicholas, in Lorraine, a single plank of
the wood of the Walnut, 25ft. wide, upon which the Emperor
Frederick III. had given a sumptuous banquet. In the
Baidar Valley, near Balaclava, in the Crimea, stands a
Walnut tree at least 1000 years old. It yields annually from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a>[<a href="./images/316.png">316</a>]</span>80,000 to 100,000 Nuts, and belongs to five Tartar families,
who share its produce equally."&mdash;<i>Gardener's Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>The economic uses of the Walnut are now chiefly confined
to the timber, which is highly prized both for furniture and
gun-stocks, and to the production of oil, which is not much
used in Europe, but is highly valued in the East. "It dries
much more slowly than any other distilled oil, and hence its
great value, as it allows the artist as much time as he requires
in order to blend his colours and finish his work. In conjunction
with amber varnish it forms a vehicle which leaves
nothing to be desired, and which doubtless was the vehicle of
Van Eyck, and in many instances of the Venetian masters,
and of Correggio."&mdash;<i>Arts of the Middle Ages</i>, preface. In
medi&aelig;val times a high medicinal value was attached to the
fruit, for the celebrated antidote against poison which was so
firmly believed in, and which was attributed to Mithridates,
King of Pontus, was chiefly composed of Walnuts. "Two
Nuttes (he is speaking of Walnuts) and two Figges, and
twenty Rewe leaves, stamped together with a little salt, and
eaten fasting, doth defende a man from poison and pestilence
that day."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bullein</span>, <i>Governmente of Health</i>, 1558.</p>

<p>The Walnut holds an honoured place in heraldry. Two
large Walnut trees overshadow the tomb of the poet Waller
in Beaconsfield churchyard, and "these are connected with
a curious piece of family history. The tree was chosen as
the Waller crest after Agincourt, where the head of the
family took the Duke of Orleans prisoner, and took afterwards
as his crest the arms of Orleans hanging by a label in
a Walnut tree with this motto for the device: <i>H&aelig;c fructus
virtutis.</i>"&mdash;<i>Gardener's Chronicle</i>, Aug., 1878.</p>

<p>Walnuts are still very popular, but not as poison antidotes;
their popularity now rests on their use as pickles,
their excellence as autumn and winter dessert fruits, and
with pseudo-gipsies for the rich olive hue that the juice will
give to the skin. These uses, together with the beauty in
the landscape that is given by an old Walnut tree, will
always secure for it a place among English trees; yet there
can be little doubt that the Walnut is a bad neighbour to
other crops, and for that reason its numbers in England have
been much diminished. Phillips said there was a decided
antipathy between Apples and Walnuts, and spoke of the
Apple tree as&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a>[<a href="./images/317.png">317</a>]</span></p>

<span class="i0i">Of Cherries."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And in this he was probably right, though the mischief
caused to the Apple tree more probably arises from the
dense shade thrown by the Walnut tree than by any malarious
exhalation emitted from it.</p>

<p>I might perhaps content myself with marking these passages
only, and dismiss Shakespeare's Wheat without further
comment, for the Wheat of his day was identical with our
own; but there are a few points in connection with English
Wheat which may be interesting. Wheat is not an English
plant, nor is it a European plant; its original home is in
Northern Asia, whence it has spread into all civilized countries.<a name="FNanchor_318:1_213" id="FNanchor_318:1_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_318:1_213" class="fnanchor">[318:1]</a>
For the cultivation of Wheat is one of the first
signs of civilized life; it marks the end of nomadic life, and
implies more or less a settled habitation. When it reached
England, and to what country we are indebted for it, we do
not know; but we know that while we are indebted to the
Romans for so many of our useful trees, and fruits, and
vegetables, we are not indebted to them for the introduction
of Wheat. This we might be almost sure of from the very
name, which has no connection with the Latin names, <i>triticum</i>
or <i>frumentum</i>, but is a pure old English word, signifying
originally <i>white</i>, and so distinguishing it as the white grain
in opposition to the darker grains of Oats and Rye. But
besides the etymological evidence, we have good historical
evidence that C&aelig;sar found Wheat growing in England when
he first landed on the shores of Kent. He daily victualled
his camp with British Wheat ("frumentum ex agris quotidie
in castra conferebat"); and it was while his soldiers were
reaping the Wheat in the Kentish fields that they were surrounded
and successfully attacked by the British. He tells
us, however, that the cultivation of Wheat was chiefly confined
to Kent, and was not much known inland: "interiores plerique
frumenta non serunt, sed lacte et carne vivunt."&mdash;<i>De
Bello Gallico</i>, v, 14. Roman Wheat has frequently been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a>[<a href="./images/319.png">319</a>]</span>found in graves, and strange stories have been told of the
plants that have been raised from these old seeds; but
a more scientific inquiry has proved that there have been
mistakes or deceits, more or less intentional, for "Wheat is
said to keep for seven years at the longest. The statements
as to mummy Wheat are wholly devoid of authenticity, as are
those of the Raspberry seeds taken from a Roman tomb."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hooker</span>,
"Botany" in <i>Science Primers</i>. The oft-repeated
stories about the vitality of mummy Wheat were effectually
disposed of when it was discovered that much of the so-called
Wheat was South American Maize.</p>

<p>Willow is an old English word, but the more common and
perhaps the older name for the Willow is Withy, a name
which is still in constant use, but more generally applied
to the twigs when cut for basket-making than to the living
tree. "Withe" is found in the oldest vocabularies, but we
do not find "Willow" till we come to the vocabularies of
the fifteenth century, when it occurs as "H&aelig;c Salex, A<sup>e</sup>
Wyllo-tre;" "H&aelig;c Salix-icis, a Welogh;" "Salix, Welig."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a>[<a href="./images/321.png">321</a>]</span>Both the names probably referred to the pliability of the
tree, and there was another name for it, the Sallow, which
was either a corruption of the Latin Salix, or was derived
from a common root. It was also called Osier.</p>

<p>The Willow is a native of Britain. It belongs to a large
family (<i>Salix</i>), numbering 160 species, of which we have
seventeen distinct species in Great Britain, besides many
sub-species and varieties. So common a plant, with the
peculiar pliability of the shoots that distinguishes all the
family, was sure to be made much use of. Its more
common uses were for basket-making, for coracles, and
huts, or "Willow-cabins" (No. <a href="#Willow_1">1</a>), but it had other uses in
the elegancies and even in the romance of life. The flowers
of the early Willow (<i>S. caprea</i>) did duty for and were called
Palms on Palm Sunday (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#Palm">Palm</a></span>), and not only the flowers
but the branches also seem to have been used in decoration,
a use which is now extinct. "The Willow is called <i>Salix</i>,
and hath his name <i>&agrave; saliendo</i>, for that it quicklie groweth
up, and soon becommeth a tree. Heerewith do they in
some countries trim up their parlours and dining roomes in
sommer, and sticke fresh greene leaves thereof about their
beds for coolness."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Newton's</span> <i>Herball for the Bible</i>.<a name="FNanchor_321:1_214" id="FNanchor_321:1_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_321:1_214" class="fnanchor">[321:1]</a></p>

<p>But if we only look at the poetry of the time of Shakespeare,
and much of the poetry before and after him, we
should almost conclude that the sole use of the Willow was
to weave garlands for jilted lovers, male and female. It
was probably with reference to this that Shakespeare represented
poor mad Ophelia hanging her flowers on the
"Willow tree aslant the brook" (No. <a href="#Willow_6">6</a>), and it is more
pointedly referred to in Nos. <a href="#Willow_2">2</a>, <a href="#Willow_4">4</a>, <a href="#Willow_5">5</a>, <a href="#Willow_7">7</a>, <a href="#Willow_8">8</a>, and <a href="#Willow_9">9</a>. The
feeling was expressed in a melancholy ditty, which must
have been very popular in the sixteenth century, of which
Desdemona says a few of the first verses (No. <a href="#Willow_7">7</a>), and which
concludes thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come all you forsaken and sit down by me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">He that plaineth of his false love, mine's falser than she;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The Willow wreath weare I, since my love did fleet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">A garland for lovers forsaken most meet."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a>[<a href="./images/322.png">322</a>]</span>
The ballad is entitled "The Complaint of a Lover Forsaken
of His Love&mdash;To a Pleasant New Tune," and is
printed in the "Roxburghe Ballads." This curious connection
of the Willow with forsaken or disappointed lovers
stood its ground for a long time. Spenser spoke of the
"Willow worne of forlorne paramoures." Drayton says
that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In love the sad forsaken wight<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The Willow garland weareth"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Muse's Elysium.</i></p>

<p>and though we have long given up the custom of wearing
garlands of any sort, yet many of us can recollect one of
the most popular street songs, that was heard everywhere,
and at last passed into a proverb, and which began&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All round my hat I vears a green Willow<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">In token," &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It has been suggested by many that this melancholy
association with the Willow arose from its Biblical associations;
and this may be so, though all the references to the
Willow that occur in the Bible are, with one notable
exception, connected with joyfulness and fertility. The one
exception is the plaintive wail in the 137th Psalm&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"By the streams of Babel, there we sat down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And we wept when we remembered Zion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">On the Willows among the rivers we hung our harps."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And this one record has been sufficient to alter the emblematic
character of the Willow&mdash;"this one incident has
made the Willow an emblem of the deepest of sorrows,
namely, sorrow for sin found out, and visited with its due
punishment. From that time the Willow appears never
again to have been associated with feelings of gladness.
Even among heathen nations, for what reason we know
not, it was a tree of evil omen, and was employed to make
the torches carried at funerals. Our own poets made the
Willow the symbol of despairing woe."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Johns.</span> This is the
more remarkable because the tree referred to in the Psalms,
the Weeping Willow (<i>Salix Babylonica</i>), which by its habit
of growth is to us so suggestive of crushing sorrow, was
quite unknown in Europe till a very recent period. "It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a>[<a href="./images/323.png">323</a>]</span>grows abundantly on the banks of the Euphrates, and other
parts of Asia, as in Palestine, and also in North Africa;"
but it is said to have been introduced into England during
the last century, and then in a curious way. "Many years
ago, the well-known poet, Alexander Pope, who resided at
Twickenham, received a basket of Figs as a present from
Turkey. The basket was made of the supple branches of
the Weeping Willow, the very same species under which
the captive Jews sat when they wept by the waters of Babylon.
The poet valued highly the small and tender twigs
associated with so much that was interesting, and he untwisted
the basket, and planted one of the branches in the
ground. It had some tiny buds upon it, and he hoped he
might be able to rear it, as none of this species of Willow
was known in England. Happily the Willow is very quick
to take root and grow. The little branch soon became a
tree, and drooped gracefully over the river, in the same
manner that its race had done over the waters of Babylon.
From that one branch all the Weeping Willows in England
are descended."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Kirby's</span> <i>Trees</i>.<a name="FNanchor_323:1_215" id="FNanchor_323:1_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_323:1_215" class="fnanchor">[323:1]</a></p>

<p>There is probably no tree that contributes so largely to
the conveniences of English life as the Willow. Putting aside
its uses in the manufacture of gunpowder and cricket bats,
we may safely say that the most scantily-furnished house can
boast of some article of Willow manufacture in the shape of
baskets. British basket-making is, as far as we know, the
oldest national manufacture; it is the manufacture in connection
with which we have the earliest record of the value
placed on British work. British baskets were exported to
Rome, and it would almost seem as if baskets were unknown
in Rome until they were introduced from Britain, for with
the article of import came the name also, and the British
"basket" became the Latin "bascauda." We have curious
evidence of the high value attached to these baskets. Juvenal
describes Catullus in fear of shipwreck throwing overboard
his most precious treasures: "precipitare volens etiam pulcherrima,"
and among these "pulcherrima" he mentions
"bascaudas." Martial bears a still higher testimony to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a>[<a href="./images/324.png">324</a>]</span>value set on "British baskets," reckoning them among the
many rich gifts distributed at the Saturnalia&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Barbara de pictis veni bascauda Britannis<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Sed me jam vult dicere Roma suam."&mdash;Book xiv, 99.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Many of the Willows make handsome shrubs for the
garden, for besides those that grow into large trees, there
are many that are low shrubs, and some so low as to be
fairly called carpet plants. Salix Regin&aelig; is one of the most
silvery shrubs we have, with very narrow leaves; S. lanata
is almost as silvery, but with larger and woolly leaves, and
makes a very pretty object when grown on rockwork near
water; S. rosmarinifolia is another desirable shrub; and
among the lower-growing species, the following will grow
well on rockwork, and completely clothe the surface: S.
alpina, S. Grahami, S. retusa, S. serpyllifolia, and S. reticulata.
They are all easily cultivated and are quite hardy.</p>

Wormwood is the product of many species of Artemisia,
a family consisting of 180 species, of which we have four in
England. The whole family is remarkable for the extreme
bitterness of all parts of the plant, so that "as bitter as
Wormwood" is one of the oldest proverbs. The plant was
named Artemisia from Artemis, the Greek name of Diana,
and for this reason: "Verily of these three Worts which
we named Artemisia, it is said that Diana should find them,
and delivered their powers and leechdom to Chiron the
Centaur, who first from these Worts set forth a leechdom,
and he named these Worts from the name of Diana, Artemis,
that is, Artemisias."&mdash;<i>Herbarium Apul&aelig;i</i>, Cockayne's
translation. The Wormwood was of very high reputation
in medicine, and is thus recommended in the Stockholm
MS.:</p>

</div></div>

<p>But even in Shakespeare's time this high character had
somewhat abated, though it was still used for all medicines
in which a strong bitter was recommended. But its chief
use seems to have been as a protection against insects of all
kinds, who might very reasonably be supposed to avoid such
a bitter food. This is Tusser's advice about the plant&mdash;</p>

<p>This quality was the origin of the names of Mugwort<a name="FNanchor_326:1_217" id="FNanchor_326:1_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_326:1_217" class="fnanchor">[326:1]</a> and
Wormwood. Its other name (in the Stockholm MS. referred
to), Avoyne or Averoyne is a corruption of the specific name
of one of the species, A. Abrotanum. Southernwood is the
southern Wormwood, <i>i.e.</i>, the foreign, as distinguished from
the native plant. The modern name for the same species
is Boy's Love, or Old Man. The last name may have come
from its hoary leaves, though different explanations are given:
the other name is given to it, according to Dr. Prior, "from
an ointment made with its ashes being used by young men
to promote the growth of a beard." There is good authority
for this derivation, but I think the name may have been
given for other reasons. "Boy's Love" is one of the most
favourite cottage-garden plants, and it enters largely into the
rustic language of flowers. No posy presented by a young
man to his lass is complete without Boy's Love; and it is an
emblem of fidelity, at least it was so once. It is, in fact, a
Forget-me-Not, from its strong abiding smell; so St. Francis
de Sales applied it: "To love in the midst of sweets, little
children could do that; but to love in the bitterness of
Wormwood is a sure sign of our affectionate fidelity." Not
that the Wormwood was ever named Forget-me-Not, for
that name was given to the Ground Pine (<i>Ajuga cham&aelig;pitys</i>)
on account of its unpleasant and long-enduring smell, until
it was transferred to the Myosotis (which then lost its old
name of Mouse-ear), and the pretty legend was manufactured
to account for the name.</p>

<p>In England Wormwood has almost fallen into complete
disuse; but in France it is largely used in the shape of
Absinthe. As a garden plant, Tarragon, which is a species
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a>[<a href="./images/327.png">327</a>]</span>of Wormwood, will claim a place in every herb garden, and
there are a few, such as A. sericea, A. cana, and A. alpina,
which make pretty shrubs for the rockwork.</p>

<p>The Yew, though undoubtedly an indigenous British
plant, has not a British name. The name is derived from
the Latin <i>Iva</i>, and "under this name we find the <i>Yew</i> so
inextricably mixed up with the <i>Ivy</i> that, as dissimilar as are
the two trees, there can be no doubt that these names are
in their origin identical." So says Dr. Prior, and he proceeds
to give a long and very interesting account of the
origin of the name. The connection of Yew with <i>iva</i> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a>[<a href="./images/328.png">328</a>]</span><i>Ivy</i> is still shown in the French <i>if</i>, the German <i>eibe</i>, and
the Portuguese <i>iva</i>. <i>Yew</i> seems to be quite a modern
form; in the old vocabularies the word is variously spelt
iw, ewe,<a name="FNanchor_328:1_219" id="FNanchor_328:1_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_328:1_219" class="fnanchor">[328:1]</a> eugh-tre,<a name="FNanchor_328:2_220" id="FNanchor_328:2_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_328:2_220" class="fnanchor">[328:2]</a> haw-tre, new-tre, ew, uhe, and iw.</p>

<p>The connection of the Yew with churchyards and funerals
is noticed by Shakespeare in Nos. <a href="#Yew_1">1</a>, <a href="#Yew_5">5</a>, and <a href="#Yew_6">6</a>, and its celebrated
connection with English bow-making in No. <a href="#Yew_3">3</a>, where
"double-fatal" may probably refer to its noxious qualities
when living and its use for deadly weapons afterwards.
These noxious qualities, joined to its dismal colour, and to
its constant use in churchyards, caused it to enter into the
supposed charms and incantations of the quacks of the
Middle Ages. Yet Gerard entirely denies its noxious qualities:
"They say that the fruit thereof being eaten is not
onely dangerous and deadly unto man, but if birds do eat
thereof it causeth them to cast their feathers and many
times to die&mdash;all which I dare boldly affirme is altogether
untrue; for when I was yong and went to schoole, divers of
my schoolfellowes, and likewise my selfe, did eat our fils of
the berries of this tree, and have not only slept under the
shadow thereof, but among the branches also, without any
hurt at all, and that not at one time but many times."
Browne says the same in his "Vulgar Errors:" "That
Yew and the berries thereof are harmlesse, we know"
(book ii. c. 7). There is no doubt that the Yew berries are
almost if not quite harmless,<a name="FNanchor_328:3_221" id="FNanchor_328:3_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_328:3_221" class="fnanchor">[328:3]</a> and I find them forming an
element in an Anglo-Saxon recipe, which may be worth
quoting as an example of the medicines to which our forefathers
submitted. It is given in a Leech Book of the tenth
century or earlier, and is thus translated by Cockayne:
"If a man is in the water elf disease, then are the nails
of his hand livid, and the eyes tearful, and he will look
downwards. Give him this for a leechdom: Everthroat,
cassuck, the netherward part of fane, a yew berry, lupin,
helenium, a head of marsh mallow, fen, mint, dill, lily,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a>[<a href="./images/329.png">329</a>]</span>attorlothe, pulegium, marrubium, dock, elder, fel terr&aelig;,
wormwood, strawberry leaves, consolida; pour them over
with ale, add holy water, sing this charm over them thrice
[here follow some long charms which I need not extract];
these charms a man may sing over a wound" ("Leech
Book," iii. 63).</p>

<p>I need say little of the uses of the Yew wood in furniture,
nor of the many grand specimens of the tree which are scattered
throughout the churchyards of England, except to
say that "the origin of planting Yew trees in churchyards
is still a subject of considerable perplexity. As the Yew
was of such great importance in war and field sports
before the use of gunpowder was known, perhaps the
parsons of parishes were required to see that the churchyard
was capable of supplying bows to the males of each
parish of proper age; but in this case we should scarcely
have been left without some evidence on the matter.
Others again state that the trees in question were intended
solely to furnish branches for use on Palm Sunday"<a name="FNanchor_329:1_222" id="FNanchor_329:1_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_329:1_222" class="fnanchor">[329:1]</a>
(<i>see</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#Palm">Palm</a></span>, p. <a href="#Page_195">195</a>), "while many suppose that the Yew
was naturally selected for planting around churches on
account of its emblematic character, as expressive of the
solemnity of death, while, from its perennial verdure and
long duration, it might be regarded as a pattern of immortality."&mdash;<i>Penny
Magazine</i>, 1843.</p>

<p>A good list of the largest and oldest Yews in England
will be found in Loudon's "Arboretum."</p>

<hr class="hrtb" />

<p>The "dismal Yew" concludes the list of Shakespeare's
plants and the first part of my proposed subject; and while
I hope that those readers who may have gone with me
so far have met with some things to interest them, I hope
also they will agree with me that gardening and the love of
flowers is not altogether the modern accomplishment that
many of our gardeners now fancy it to be. Here are two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a>[<a href="./images/330.png">330</a>]</span>hundred names of plants in one writer, and that writer not
at all writing on horticulture, but only mentioning plants
and flowers in the most incidental manner as they happened
naturally to fall in his way. I should doubt if there
is any similar instance in any modern English writer, and
feel very sure that there is no such instance in any modern
English dramatist. It shows how familiar gardens and
flowers were to Shakespeare, and that he must have had
frequent opportunities for observing his favourites (for most
surely he was fond of flowers), not only in their wild and
native homes, but in the gardens of farmhouses and parsonages,
country houses, and noblemen's stately pleasaunces.
The quotations that I have been able to make from the
early writers in the ninth and tenth centuries, down to
gossiping old Gerard, the learned Lord Chancellor Bacon,
and that excellent old gardiner Parkinson, all show the
same thing, that the love of flowers is no new thing in
England, still less a foreign fashion, but that it is innate in
us, a real instinct, that showed itself as strongly in our
forefathers as in ourselves; and when we find that such
men as Shakespeare and Lord Bacon (to mention no
others) were almost proud to show their knowledge of
plants and love of flowers, we can say that such love and
knowledge is thoroughly manly and English.</p>

<p>In the inquiry into Shakespeare's plants I have entered
somewhat largely into the etymological history of the names.
I have been tempted into this by the personal interest I feel
in the history of plant names, and I hope it may not have
been uninteresting to my readers; but I do not think this
part of the subject could have been passed by, for I agree
with Johnston: "That there is more interest and as much
utility in settling the nomenclature of our pastoral bards as
that of all herbalists and dry-as-dust botanists" ("Botany
of the Eastern Border"). I have also at times entered into
the botany and physiology of the plants; this may have
seemed needless to some, but I have thought that such
notices were often necessary to the right understanding of
the plants named, and again I shelter myself under the
authority of a favourite old author: "Consider (gentle
readers) what shiftes he shall be put unto, and how rawe he
must needs be in explanation of metaphors, resemblances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a>[<a href="./images/331.png">331</a>]</span>and comparisons, that is ignorant of the nature of herbs and
plants from whence their similitudes be taken, for the
inlightening and garnishing of sentences."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Newton's</span>
<i>Herball for the Bible</i>.</p>

<p>I have said that my subject naturally divides itself into
two parts, first, The Plants and Flowers named by Shakespeare;
second, His Knowledge of Gardens and Gardening.
The first part is now concluded, and I go to the
second part, which will be very much shorter, and which
may be entitled "The Garden-craft of Shakespeare."</p>

<h2>GARDEN-CRAFT.</h2>

<p><span class="dropcapa"><span class="dropcap">A</span></span>NY account of the "Plant-lore of
Shakespeare" would be very incomplete
if it did not include his "Garden-craft."
There are a great many
passages scattered throughout his
works, some of them among the
most beautiful that he ever wrote,
in which no particular tree, herb, or
flower is mentioned by name, but
which show his intimate knowledge
of plants and gardening, and his great affection for them. It
is from these passages, even more than from the passages I
have already quoted, in which particular flowers are named,
that we learn how thoroughly his early country life had
influenced and marked his character, and how his whole
spirit was most naturally coloured by it. Numberless allusions
to flowers and their culture prove that his boyhood
and early manhood were spent in the country, and that as
he passed through the parks, fields, and lanes of his native
county, or spent pleasant days in the gardens and orchards
of the manor-houses and farm-houses of the neighbourhood,
his eyes and ears were open to all the sights and sounds of
a healthy country life, and he was, perhaps unconsciously,
laying up in his memory a goodly store of pleasant pictures
and homely country talk, to be introduced in his own wonderful
way in tragedies and comedies, which, while often
professedly treating of very different times and countries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a>[<a href="./images/336.png">336</a>]</span>have really given us some of the most faithful pictures of
the country life of the Englishman of Queen Elizabeth's
time, drawn with all the freshness and simplicity that can
only come from a real love of the subject.</p>

<p>"Flowers I noted," is his own account of himself (Sonnet
xcix.), and with what love he noted them, and with what
carefulness and faithfulness he wrote of them, is shown in
every play he published, and almost in every act and every
scene. And what I said of his notices of particular flowers
is still more true of his general descriptions&mdash;that they are
never laboured, or introduced as for a purpose, but that
each passage is the simple utterance of his ingrained love
of the country, the natural outcome of a keen, observant
eye, joined to a great power of faithful description, and an
unlimited command of the fittest language. It is this
vividness and freshness that gives such a reality to all
Shakespeare's notices of country life, and which make
them such pleasant reading to all lovers of plants and
gardening.</p>

<p>These notices of the "Garden-craft of Shakespeare" I
now proceed to quote; but my quotations in this part will
be made on a different plan to that which I adopted in the
account of his "Plant-lore." I shall not here think it necessary
to quote all the passages in which he mentions different
objects of country life, but I shall content myself with such
passages as throw light on his knowledge of horticulture,
and which to some extent illustrate the horticulture of his
day, and these passages I must arrange under a few general
heads. In this way the second part of my subject will be
very much shorter than my first, but I have good reasons
for hoping that those who have been interested in the long
account of the "Plant-lore of Shakespeare" will be equally
interested in the shorter account of his "Garden-craft,"
and will acknowledge that the one would be incomplete
without the other. I commence with those passages which
treat generally of&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of all the vain assumptions of these coxcombical times,
that which arrogates the pre-eminence in the true science of
gardening is the vainest. True, our conservatories are full
of the choicest plants from every clime: we ripen the Grape
and the Pine-apple with an art unknown before, and even
the Mango, the Mangosteen, and the Guava are made to
yield their matured fruits; but the real beauty and poetry
of a garden are lost in our efforts after rarity, and strangeness,
and variety." So, nearly forty years ago, wrote the
author of "The Poetry of Gardening," a pleasant, though
somewhat fantastic essay, first published in the "Carthusian,"
and afterwards re-published in Murray's "Reading for the
Rail," in company with an excellent article from the "Quarterly"
by the same author under the title of "The Flower
Garden;" and I quote it because this "vain assumption"
is probably stronger and more widespread now than when that
article was written. We often hear and read accounts of
modern gardening in which it is coolly assumed, and almost
taken for granted, that the science of horticulture, and
almost the love of flowers, is a product of the nineteenth
century. But the love of flowers is no new taste in Englishmen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"></a>[<a href="./images/340.png">340</a>]</span>and the science of horticulture is in no way a modern
science. We have made large progress in botanical science
during the present century, and our easy communications
with the whole habitable globe have brought to us thousands
of new and beautiful plants in endless varieties; and we
have many helps in gardening that were quite unknown to
our forefathers. Yet there were brave old gardeners in our
forefathers' times, and a very little acquaintance with the
literature of the sixteenth century will show that in Shakespeare's
time there was a most healthy and manly love of
flowers for their own sake, and great industry and much
practical skill in gardening. We might, indeed, go much
further back than the fifteenth century, and still find the
same love and the same skill. We have long lists of plants
grown in times before the Conquest, with treatises on gardening,
in which there is much that is absurd, but which
show a practical experience in the art, and which show also
that the gardens of those days were by no means ill-furnished
either with fruit or flowers. Coming a little later, Chaucer
takes every opportunity to speak with a most loving affection
for flowers, both wild and cultivated, and for well-kept gardens;
and Spenser's poems show a familiar acquaintance with
them, and a warm admiration for them. Then in Shakespeare's
time we have full records of the gardens and gardening
which must have often met his eye; and we find that
they were not confined to a few fine places here and there,
but that good gardens were the necessary adjunct to every
country house, and that they were cultivated with a zeal and
a skill that would be a credit to any gardener of our own
day. In Harrison's description of "England in Shakespeare's
Youth," recently published by the new Shakespeare Society,
we find that Harrison himself, though only a poor country
parson, "took pains with his garden, in which, though its
area covered but 300ft. of ground, there was 'a simple' for
each foot of ground, no one of them being common or
usually to be had." About the same time Gerard's Catalogues
show that he grew in his London garden more than
a thousand species of hardy plants; and Lord Bacon's
famous "Essay on Gardens" not only shows what a grand
idea of gardening he had himself, but also that this idea
was not Utopian, but one that sprang from personal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a>[<a href="./images/341.png">341</a>]</span>acquaintance with stately gardens, and from an innate love of
gardens and flowers. Almost at the same time, but a little
later, we come to the celebrated "John Parkinson, Apothecary
of London, the King's Herbarist," whose "Paradisus
Terrestris," first published in 1629, is indeed "a choise
garden of all sorts of rarest flowers." His collection of
plants would even now be considered an excellent collection,
if it could be brought together, while his descriptions and
cultural advice show him to have been a thorough practical
gardener, who spoke of plants and gardens from the experience
of long-continued hard work amongst them. And
contemporary with him was Milton, whose numerous descriptions
of flowers are nearly all of cultivated plants, as he
must have often seen them in English gardens.</p>

<p>And so we are brought to the conclusion that in the passages
quoted above in which Shakespeare speaks so lovingly
and tenderly of his favourite flowers, these expressions are
not to be put down to the fancy of the poet, but that he was
faithfully describing what he daily saw or might have seen,
and what no doubt he watched with that carefulness and
exactness which could only exist in conjunction with a real
affection for the objects on which he gazed, "the fresh and
fragrant flowers," "the pretty flow'rets," "the sweet flowers,"
"the beauteous flowers," "the sweet summer buds," "the
blossoms passing fair," "the darling buds of May."</p>

<p>The flower-gardens of Shakespeare's time were very different
to the flower-gardens of our day; but we have so
many good descriptions of them in books and pictures that
we have no difficulty in realizing them both in their general
form and arrangement. I am now speaking only of the
flower-gardens; the kitchen-gardens and orchards were very
much like our own, except in the one important difference,
that they had necessarily much less glass than our modern
gardens can command. In the flower-garden the grand
leading principle was uniformity and formality carried out
into very minute details. "The garden is best to be square,"
was Lord Bacon's rule; "the form that men like in general
is a square, though roundness be <i>forma perfectissima</i>," was
Lawson's rule; and this form was chosen because the garden
was considered to be a purtenance and continuation of the
house, designed so as strictly to harmonize with the architecture
of the building. And Parkinson's advice was to the
same effect: "The orbicular or round form is held in its
own proper existence to be the most absolute form, containing
within it all other forms whatsoever; but few, I think,
will chuse such a proportion to be joyned to their habitation.
The triangular or three-square form is such a form
also as is seldom chosen by any that may make another
choise. The four-square form is the most usually accepted
with all, and doth best agree with any man's dwelling."</p>

<p>This square enclosure was bounded either by a high wall&mdash;"circummured
with brick," "with high walles embatailled,"&mdash;or
with a thick high hedge&mdash;"encompassed on
all the four sides with a stately arched hedge." These
hedges were made chiefly of Holly or Hornbeam, and we
can judge of their size by Evelyn's description of his "impregnable
hedge of about 400ft. in length, 9ft. high, and
5ft. in diameter." Many of these hedges still remain in our
old gardens. Within this enclosure the garden was accurately
laid out in formal shapes,<a name="FNanchor_343:1_223" id="FNanchor_343:1_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_343:1_223" class="fnanchor">[343:1]</a> with paths either quite
straight or in some strictly mathematical figures&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a>[<a href="./images/344.png">344</a>]</span></p>

<span class="i0i">"And all without were walkes and alleyes dight<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">With divers trees enrang'd in even rankes;<br /></span>

<span class="i0i">To sit and rest the walkers' wearie shankes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>F. Q.</i>, iv, x, 25.<br /></p>

<p>The main walks were not, as with us, bounded with the
turf, but they were bounded with trees, which were wrought
into hedges, more or less open at the sides, and arched over
at the top. These formed the "close alleys," "coven
alleys," or "thick-pleached alleys," of which we read in
Shakespeare and others writers of that time. Many kinds
of trees and shrubs were used for this purpose; "every one
taketh what liketh him best, as either Privit alone, or Sweet
Bryer and White Thorn interlaced together, and Roses
of one, two, or more sorts placed here and there amongst
them. Some also take Lavender, Rosemary, Sage, Southernwood,
Lavender Cotton, or some such other thing. Some
again plant Cornel trees, and plash them or keep them low
to form them into a hedge; and some again take a low
prickly shrub that abideth always green, called in Latin
Pyracantha" (Parkinson). It was on these hedges and
their adjuncts that the chief labour of the garden was spent.
They were cut and tortured into every imaginable shape,
for nothing came amiss to the fancy of the topiarist. When
this topiary art first came into fashion in England I do
not know, but it was probably more or less the fashion in
all gardens of any pretence from very early times, and it
reached its highest point in the sixteenth century, and held
its ground as the perfection of gardening till it was driven
out of the field in the last century by the "picturesque
style," though many specimens still remain in England, as
at Levens<a name="FNanchor_344:1_224" id="FNanchor_344:1_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_344:1_224" class="fnanchor">[344:1]</a> and Hardwicke on a large scale, and in the
gardens of many ancient English mansions and old farmhouses
on a smaller scale. It was doomed as soon as landscape
gardeners aimed at the natural, for even when it was
still at its height Addison described it thus: "Our British
gardeners, instead of humouring Nature, love to deviate from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a>[<a href="./images/345.png">345</a>]</span>it as much as possible. Our trees rise in cones, globes, and
pyramids; we see the mark of the scissors upon every plant
and bush."</p>

<p>But this is a digression: I must return to the Elizabethan
garden, which I have hitherto only described as a great
square, surrounded by wide, covered, shady walks, and with
other similar walks dividing the central square into four or
more compartments. But all this was introductory to the
great feature of the Elizabethan garden, the formation of
the "curious-knotted garden." Each of the large compartments
was divided into a complication of "knots," by which
was meant beds arranged in quaint patterns, formed by rule
and compass with mathematical precision, and so numerous
that it was a necessary part of the system that the whole
square should be fully occupied by them. Lawn there was
none; the whole area was nothing but the beds and the
paths that divided them. There was Grass in other parts
of the pleasure grounds, and apparently well kept, for Lord
Bacon has given his opinion that "nothing is more pleasant
to the eye than green Grass kept finely shorn," but it was
apparently to be found only in the orchard, the bowling-green,
or the "wilderness;" in the flower-garden proper it
had no place. The "knots" were generally raised above
the surface of the paths, the earth being kept in its place
by borders of lead, or tiles, or wood, or even bones; but
sometimes the beds and paths were on the same level, and
then there were the same edgings that we now use, as
Thrift, Box, Ivy, flints, &amp;c. The paths were made of gravel,
sand, spar, &amp;c., and sometimes with coloured earths: but
against this Lord Bacon made a vigorous protest: "As to
the making of knots or figures with divers coloured earths,
that they may lie under the windows of the house on that

<p>The old gardening books are full of designs for these
knots; indeed, no gardening book of the date seems to
have been considered complete if it did not give the "latest
designs," and they seem to have much tried the wit and
ingenuity of the gardeners, as they must have also sorely tried
their patience to keep them in order; and I doubt not that
the efficiency of an Elizabethan gardener was as much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a>[<a href="./images/346.png">346</a>]</span>tested by his skill and experience in "knot-work," as the
efficiency of a modern gardener is tested by his skill in
"bedding-out," which is the lineal descendant of "knot-work."
In one most essential point, however, the two systems
very much differed. In "bedding-out" the whole force of
the system is spent in producing masses of colours, the individual
flowers being of no importance, except so far as
each flower contributes its little share of colour to the general
mass; and it is for this reason that so many of us dislike
the system, not only because of its monotony, but more
especially because it has a tendency "to teach us to think
too little about the plants individually, and to look at them
chiefly as an assemblage of beautiful colours. It is difficult
in those blooming masses to separate one from another; all
produce so much the same sort of impression. The consequence
is people see the flowers on the beds without caring
to know anything about them or even to ask their names.
It was different in the older gardens, because there was just
variety there; the plants strongly contrasted with each other,
and we were ever passing from the beautiful to the curious.
Now we get little of quaintness or mystery, or of the strange
delicious thought of being lost or embosomed in a tall rich
wood of flowers. All is clear, definite, and classical, the work
of a too narrow and exclusive taste."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Forbes Watson.</span>
The old "knot-work" was not open to this censure, though
no doubt it led the way which ended in "bedding-out."
The beginning of the system crept in very shortly after
Shakespeare's time. Parkinson spoke of an arrangement of
spring flowers which, when "all planted in some proportion
as near one unto another as is fit for them will give such a
grace to the garden that the place will seem like a piece of
tapestry of many glorious colours, to encrease every one's
delight." And again&mdash;"The Tulipas may be so matched,
one colour answering and setting off another, that the place
where they stand may resemble a piece of curious needlework
or piece of painting." But these plants were all
perennial, and remained where they were once planted, and
with this one exception named by Parkinson, the planting
of knot-work was as different as possible from the modern
planting of carpet-beds. The beds were planted inside their
thick margins with a great variety of plants, and apparently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a>[<a href="./images/347.png">347</a>]</span>set as thick as possible, like Harrison's garden quoted above,
with its 300 separate plants in as many square feet. These
were nearly all hardy perennials,<a name="FNanchor_347:1_225" id="FNanchor_347:1_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_347:1_225" class="fnanchor">[347:1]</a> with the addition of a
few hardy annuals, and the great object seems to have been
to have had something of interest or beauty in these gardens
at all times of the year. The principle of the old gardeners
was that "Nature abhors a vacuum," and, as far as their
gardens went, they did their best to prevent a vacuum occurring
at any time. In this way I think they surpassed us in
their practical gardening, for, even if they did not always
succeed, it was surely something for them to aim (in Lord
Bacon's happy words), "to have <i>ver perpetuum</i> as the place
affords."</p>

<p>Where the space would allow of it, the garden was further
decorated with statues, fountains, "fair mounts," labyrinths,
mazes,<a name="FNanchor_347:2_226" id="FNanchor_347:2_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_347:2_226" class="fnanchor">[347:2]</a> arbours and alcoves, rocks, "great Turkey jars," and
"in some corner (or more) a true Dial or Clock, and some
Antick works" (Lawson). These things were fitting ornaments
in such formal gardens, but the best judges saw that
they were not necessaries, and that the garden was complete
without them. "They be pretty things to look on, but nothing
for health or sweetness." "Such things are for state and
magnificence, but nothing to the true pleasure of a garden."</p>

<p>Such was the Elizabethan garden in its general outlines;
the sort of garden which Shakespeare must have often seen
both in Warwickshire and in London. According to our
present ideas such a garden would be far too formal and
artificial, and we may consider that the present fashion of
our gardens is more according to Milton's idea of Eden, in
which there grew&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a>[<a href="./images/348.png">348</a>]</span>
None of us probably would now wish to exchange the
straight walks and level terraces of the sixteenth century for
our winding walks and undulating lawns, in the laying out
of which the motto has been "ars est celare artem"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Yet it is pleasant to look back upon these old gardens, and
to see how they were cherished and beloved by some of the
greatest and noblest of Englishmen. Spenser has left on
record his judgment on the gardens of his day&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0i">"To the gay gardens his unstaid desire<br /></span>

<span class="i0i">And Arte, with her contending, doth aspire<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">To excell the naturall with made delights;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And all, that faire or pleasant may be found,<br /></span>

<span class="i0i">And takes survey, with curious busie eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Of every flowre and herbe there set in order."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Muiopotmos.</i></p>

<p>Clearly in Spenser's eyes the formalities of an Elizabethan
garden (for we must suppose he had such in his thoughts)
did not exclude nature or beauty.</p>

<p>It was also with such formal gardens in his mind and before
his eyes that Lord Bacon wrote his "Essay on Gardens,"
and commenced it with the well-known sentence (for I must
quote him once again for the last time), "God Almighty
first planted a garden, and indeed it is the purest of all
human pleasures; it is the greatest refreshment to the spirits
of man, without which buildings and palaces are but gross
handiworks; and a man shall ever see, that when ages grow
to civility and elegance, men come to build stately sooner
than to garden finely, as if gardening were the greater perfection."
And, indeed, in spite of their stiffness and unnaturalness,
there must have been a great charm in those
gardens, and though it would be antiquarian affectation to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a>[<a href="./images/349.png">349</a>]</span>attempt or wish to restore them, yet there must have been a
stateliness about them which our gardens have not, and they
must have had many points of real comfort which it seems a
pity to have lost. Those long shady "covert alleys," with
their "thick-pleached" sides and roof, must have been very
pleasant places to walk in, giving shelter in winter, and in
summer deep shade, with the pleasant smell of Sweet Brier
and Roses. They must have been the very places for a
thoughtful student, who desired quiet and retirement for his
thoughts&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And adde to these retired leisure<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">That in trim gardens takes his pleasure"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Il Penseroso.</i></p>

<p>and they must have been also "pretty retiring places for
conference" for friends in council. The whole fashion of
the Elizabethan garden has passed away, and will probably
never be revived; but before we condemn it as a ridiculous
fashion, unworthy of the science of gardening, we may remember
that it held its ground in England for nearly two
hundred years, and that during that time the gardens of
England and the flowers they bore won not the cold admiration,
but the warm affection of the greatest names in English
history, the affection of such a queen as Elizabeth,<a name="FNanchor_349:1_227" id="FNanchor_349:1_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_349:1_227" class="fnanchor">[349:1]</a> of such
a grave and wise philosopher as Bacon, of such a grand hero
as Raleigh, of such poets as Spenser and Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Very little is recorded of the gardeners of the sixteenth
century, by which we can judge either of their skill or their
social position. Gerard frequently mentions the names of
different persons from whom he obtained plants, but without
telling us whether they were professional or amateur
gardeners or nurserymen; and Hakluyt has recorded the
name of Master Wolfe as gardener to Henry VIII. Certainly
Richard II.'s Queen did not speak with much respect to her
gardener, reproving him for his "harsh rude tongue," and
addressing him as a "little better thing than earth"&mdash;but
her angry grief may account for that. Parkinson also has
not much to say in favour of the gardeners of his day, but
considers it his duty to warn his readers against them:
"Our English gardeners are all, or the most of them, utterly
ignorant in the ordering of their outlandish (<i>i.e.</i>, exotic)
flowers as not being trained to know them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And I do
wish all gentlemen and gentlewomen, whom it may concern
for their own good, to be as careful whom they trust with
the planting and replanting of their fine flowers, as they
would be with so many jewels, for the roots of many of
them being small and of great value may soon be conveyed
away, and a clean tale fair told, that such a root is rotten or
perished in the ground if none be seen where it should be,
or else that the flower hath changed his colour when it hath
been taken away, or a counterfeit one hath been put in the
place thereof; and thus many have been deceived of their
daintiest flowers, without remedy or true knowledge of the
defect." And again, "idle and ignorant gardeners who get
names by stealth as they do many other things." This is
not a pleasant picture either of the skill or honesty of the
sixteenth-century gardeners, but there must have been skilled
gardeners to keep those curious-knotted gardens in order, so
as to have a "<i>ver perpetuum</i> all the year." And there must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a>[<a href="./images/351.png">351</a>]</span>have been men also who had a love for their craft; and if
some stole the rare plants committed to their charge, we
must hope that there were some honest men amongst them,
and that they were not all like old Andrew Fairservice, in
"Rob Roy," who wished to find a place where he "wad hear
pure doctrine, and hae a free cow's grass, and a cot and a
yard, and mair than ten punds of annual fee," but added
also, "and where there's nae leddy about the town to count
the Apples."</p>

This most interesting passage would almost tempt us to
say that Shakespeare was a gardener by profession; certainly
no other passages that have been brought to prove his real
profession are more minute than this. It proves him to have
had practical experience in the work, and I think we may
safely say that he was no mere 'prentice hand in the use of
the pruning knife.</p>

<p>The art of pruning in his day was probably exactly like
our own, as far as regarded fruit trees and ordinary garden
work, but in one important particular the pruner's art of that
day was a for more laborious art than it is now. The topiary
art must have been the triumph of pruning, and when
gardens were full of castles, monsters, beasts, birds, fishes,
and men, all cut out of Box and Yew, and kept so exact that
they boasted of being the "living representations" and
"counterfeit presentments" of these various objects, the hands
and head of the pruner could seldom have been idle; the
pruning knife and scissors must have been in constant
demand from the first day of the year to the last. The
pruner of that day was, in fact, a sculptor, who carved his
images out of Box and Yew instead of marble, so that in an
amusing article in the "Guardian" for 1713 (No. 173), said
to have been written by Pope, is a list of such sculptured
objects for sale, and we are told that the "eminent town
gardener had arrived to such perfection that he cuts family
pieces of men, women, and children. Any ladies that please
may have their own effigies in Myrtle, or their husbands in
Hornbeam. He is a Puritan wag, and never fails when he
shows his garden to repeat that passage in the Psalms, 'Thy
wife shall be as the fruitful Vine, and thy children as Olive
branches about thy table.'"</p>

<p>The only point that needs notice under this head is that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a>[<a href="./images/353.png">353</a>]</span>the word "manure" in Shakespeare's time was not limited to
its present modern meaning. In his day "manured land"
generally meant cultured land in opposition to wild and
barren land.<a name="FNanchor_353:1_228" id="FNanchor_353:1_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_353:1_228" class="fnanchor">[353:1]</a> So Falstaff uses the word&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for the cold blood
he did naturally inherit of his father, he hath, like lean,
sterile and bare land, manured, husbanded, and tilled with
excellent endeavour of drinking good and good store of
fertile sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant.</p>

<p>Either to have it (a garden) sterile with idleness or manured
with industry.</p>
</div>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Othello</i>, act i, sc. 3 (296).</p>

<p>Milton and many other writers used the word in this its
original sense; and Johnson explains it "to cultivate by
manual labour," according to its literal derivation. In one
passage Shakespeare uses the word somewhat in the modern
sense&mdash;</p>

<p>With this beautiful description of the winter-life of hardy
perennial plants, I may well close the "Plant-lore and
Garden-craft of Shakespeare." The subject has stretched
to a much greater extent than I at all anticipated when I
commenced it, but this only shows how large and interesting
a task I undertook, for I can truly say that my difficulty
has been in the necessity for condensing my matter,
which I soon found might be made to cover a much larger
space than I have given to it; for my object was in no case
to give an exhaustive account of the flowers, but only to
give such an account of each plant as might illustrate its
special use by Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Having often quoted my favourite authority in gardening
matters, old "John Parkinson, Apothecary, of London," I
will again make use of him to help me to say my last words:
"Herein I have spent my time, pains, and charge, which, if
well accepted, I shall think well employed. And thus I
have finished this work, and have furnished it with whatsoever
could bring delight to those that take pleasure in those
things, which how well or ill done I must abide every one's
censure; the judicious and courteous I only respect; and
so Farewell."</p>

The following Paper on the Daisy was written for the Bath
Natural History and Antiquarian Field Club, and read at
their meeting, January 14th, 1874. It was then published
in "The Garden," and a few copies were reprinted for private
circulation. I now publish it as an Appendix to the "Plant-lore
of Shakespeare," with very few alterations from its
original form, preferring thus to reprint it <i>in extenso</i> than to
make an abstract of it for the illustration of Shakespeare's
Daisies.</p></div>

<h2>THE DAISY.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapi"><span class="dropcap">I</span></span> ALMOST feel that I ought to apologize
to the Field Club for asking
them to listen to a paper on so
small a subject as the Daisy. But,
indeed, I have selected that subject
because I think it is one especially
suited to a Naturalists' Field Club.
The members of such a club, as I
think, should take notice of everything.
Nothing should be beneath
their notice. It should be their province to note a multitude
of little facts unnoticed by others; they should be
"minute philosophers," and they might almost take as their
motto the wise words which Milton put into the mouth of
Adam, after he had been instructed to "be lowlie wise"
(especially in the study of the endless wonders of sea, and
earth, and sky that surrounded him)&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"To know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That which before us lies in daily life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the prime wisdom."&mdash;<i>Paradise Lost</i>, viii. (192).<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I do not apologize for the lowness and humbleness of my
subject, but, with "no delay of preface" (Milton), I take
you at once to it. In speaking of the Daisy, I mean to
confine myself to the Daisy, commonly so-called, merely reminding
you that there are also the Great or Ox-eye, or
Moon Daisy (<i>Chrysanthemum leucanthemum</i>), the Michaelmas
Daisy (<i>Aster</i>), and the Blue Daisy of the South of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a>[<a href="./images/362.png">362</a>]</span>Europe (<i>Globularia</i>). The name has been also given to a
few other plants, but none of them are true Daisies.</p>

<p>I begin with its name. Of this there can be little doubt;
it is the "Day's-eye," the bright little eye that only opens
by day, and goes to sleep at night. This, whether the true
derivation or not, is no modern fancy. It is, at least, as old
as Chaucer, and probably much older. Here are Chaucer's
well-known words&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"Men by reason well it calle may<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Da&iuml;sie, or else the Eye of Day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Empresse and the flowre of flowres all."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And Ben Jonson boldly spoke of them as "bright Daye's-eyes."</p>

<p>There is, however, another derivation. Dr. Prior says:
"Skinner derives it from dais or canopy, and Gavin Douglas
seems to have understood it in the sense of a small canopy
in the line:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Daisie did unbraid her crounall small.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Had we not the A.-S. d&aelig;ges-eage, we could hardly refuse
to admit that this last is a far more obvious and probable
explanation of the word than the pretty poetical thought
conveyed in Day's-eye." This was Dr. Prior's opinion in
his first edition of his valuable "Popular Names of British
Plants;" but it is withdrawn in his second edition, and he
now is content with the Day's-eye derivation. Dr. Prior has
kindly informed me that he rejected it because he can find
no old authority for Skinner's derivation, and because it is
doubtful whether the Daisy in Gavin Douglas's line does
not mean a Marigold, and not what we call a Daisy. The
derivation, however, seemed worth a passing notice. Its
other English names are Dog Daisy, to distinguish it from
the large Ox-eyed Daisy; Banwort, "because it helpeth
bones<a name="FNanchor_362:1_230" id="FNanchor_362:1_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_362:1_230" class="fnanchor">[362:1]</a> to knit agayne" (Turner); Bruisewort, for the same
reason; Herb Margaret, from its French name; and in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a>[<a href="./images/363.png">363</a>]</span>North, Bairnwort, from its associations with childhood. As
to its other names, the plant seems to have been unknown
to the Greeks, and has no Greek name, but is fortunate in
having as pretty a name in Latin as it has in English. Its
modern botanical name is Bellis, and it has had the name
from the time of Pliny. Bellis must certainly come from
<i>bellus</i> (pretty), and so it is at once stamped as the pretty
one even by botanists&mdash;though another derivation has been
given to the name, of which I will speak soon. The French
call it Marguerite, no doubt for its pearly look, or Pasquerette,
to mark it as the spring flower; the German name
for it is very different, and not easy to explain&mdash;G&auml;nseblume,
<i>i.e.</i>, Goose-flower; the Danish name is Tusinfryd (thousand
joys); and the Welsh, Sensigl (trembling star).</p>

<p>As Pliny is the first that mentions the plant, his account
is worth quoting. "As touching a Daisy," he says (I quote
from Holland's translation, 1601), "a yellow cup it hath
also, and the same is crowned, as it were, with a garland,
consisting of five and fifty little leaves, set round about it in
manner of fine pales. These be flowers of the meadow, and
most of such are of no use at all, no marvile, therefore, if
they be namelesse; howbeit, some give them one tearme
and some another" (book xxi. cap. 8). And again, "There
is a hearbe growing commonly in medows, called the Daisie,
with a white floure, and partly inclining to red, which, if it
is joined with Mugwort in an ointment, is thought to make
the medicine farre more effectual for the King's evil" (book
xxvi. cap. 5).</p>

<p>We have no less than three legends of the origin of the
flower. In one legend, not older, I believe, than the fourteenth
century (the legend is given at full length by Chaucer
in his "Legende of Goode Women"), Alcestis was turned
into a Daisy. Another legend records that "this plant is
called Bellis, because it owes its origin to Belides, a granddaughter
to Danaus, and one of the nymphs called Dryads,
that presided over the meadows and pastures in ancient
times. Belides is said to have encouraged the suit of Ephigeus,
but whilst dancing on the grass with this rural deity
she attracted the admiration of Vertumnus, who, just as he
was about to seize her in his embrace, saw her transformed
into the humble plant that now bears her name." This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364"></a>[<a href="./images/364.png">364</a>]</span>legend I have only seen in Phillips's "Flora Historica." I
need scarcely tell you that neither Belides or Ephigeus are
classical names&mdash;they are medi&aelig;val inventions. The next
legend is a Celtic one; I find it recorded both by Lady
Wilkinson and Mrs. Lankester. I should like to know its
origin; but with that grand contempt for giving authorities
which lady-authors too often show, neither of these ladies
tells us whence she got the legend. The legend says that
"the virgins of Morven, to soothe the grief of Malvina, who
had lost her infant son, sang to her, 'We have seen, O!
Malvina, we have seen the infant you regret, reclining on
a light mist; it approached us, and shed on our fields a
harvest of new flowers. Look, O! Malvina. Among these
flowers we distinguish one with a golden disk surrounded
by silver leaves; a sweet tinge of crimson adorns its delicate
rays; waved by a gentle wind, we might call it a little infant
playing in a green meadow; and the flower of thy bosom
has given a new flower to the hills of Cromla.'" Since that
day the daughters of Morven have consecrated the Daisy
to infancy. "It is," said they, "the flower of innocence, the
flower of the newborn." Besides these legends, the Daisy
is also connected with the legendary history of St. Margaret.
The legend is given by Chaucer, but I will tell it to you in
the words of a more modern poet&mdash;</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of the general association of Daisies with
St. Margaret, Mrs. Jameson says that she has seen one, and
only one, picture of St. Margaret with Daisies.</p>

<p>The poetry or poetical history of the Daisy is very curious.
It begins with Chaucer, whose love of the flower might
almost be called an idolatry. But, as it begins with Chaucer,
so, for a time, it almost ends with him. Spenser, Shakespeare,
and Milton scarcely mention it. It holds almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a>[<a href="./images/365.png">365</a>]</span>no place in the poetry of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries; but, at the close of the eighteenth century, it has
the good luck to be uprooted by Burns's plough, and he at
once sings its dirge and its beauties; and then the flower at
once becomes a celebrity. Wordsworth sings of it in many
a beautiful verse; and I think it is scarcely too much to say
that since his time not an English poet has failed to pay his
homage to the humble beauty of the Daisy. I do not
purpose to take you through all these poets&mdash;time and
knowledge would fail me to introduce you to them all. I
shall but select some of those which I consider best worth
selection. I begin, of course, with Chaucer, and even with
him I must content myself with a selection&mdash;</p>

<p>I could give you several other quotations from Chaucer,

<p>Stephen Hawes, who lived in the time of Henry VII.,
wrote a poem called the "Temple of Glass." In that
temple he tells us&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"I saw depycted upon a wall,<br /></span>

<span class="i0i">How she was turned into a Daysye."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We next come to Spenser. In the "Muiopotmos," he
gives a list of flowers that the butterfly frequents, with most
descriptive epithets to each flower most happily chosen.
Among the flowers are&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Roses raigning in the pride of May,<br /></span>

of much beauty, that commences the June Eclogue of the
"Shepherd's Calendar."</p>

<p>From Spenser we come to Shakespeare, and when we
remember the vast acquaintance with flowers of every kind
that he shows, and especially when we remember how often
he almost seems to go out of his way to tell of the simple
wild flowers of England, it is surprising that the Daisy is
almost passed over entirely by him. Here are the passages
in which he names the flowers. First, in the poem of the
"Rape of Lucrece," he has a very pretty picture of Lucrece
as she lay asleep&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Without the bed her other faire hand was<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">On the green coverlet, whose perfect white<br /></span>

<p>In "Love's Labour's Lost" is the song of Spring, beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When Daisies pied, and Violets blue;<br /></span>

<span class="i1i">Do paint the meadows with delight."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In "Hamlet" Daisies are twice mentioned in connection
with Ophelia in her madness. "There's a Daisy!" she said,
as she distributed her flowers; but she made no comment
on the Daisy as she did on her other flowers. And, in the
description of her death, the Queen tells us that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There with fantastick garlands did she come<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Of Crow-flowers, Nettles, Daisies, and Long Purples."<br /></span>

<p>These are the only places in which the Daisy is mentioned
in Shakespeare's plays, and it is a little startling to
find that of these six one is in a song for clowns, and two
others are connected with the poor mad princess. I hope
that you will not use Shakespeare's authority against me,
that to talk of Daisies is only fit for clowns and madmen.</p>

<p>Contemporary with Shakespeare was Cutwode, who in the

Daisy&mdash;</p>

<p>I am not surprised to find that Milton barely mentions
the Daisy. His knowledge of plants was very small compared
to Shakespeare's, and seems to have been, for the
most part, derived from books. His descriptions of plants
all savour more of study than the open air. I only know of
two places in which he mentions the Daisy. In the "l'Allegro"
he speaks of "Meadows trim with Daisies pied,"
and in another place he speaks of "Daisies trim." But I am
surprised to find the Daisy overlooked by two such poets as
Robert Herrick and George Herbert. Herrick sang of
flowers most sweetly, few if any English poets have sung of
them more sweetly, but he has little to say of the Daisy. He
has one poem, indeed, addressed specially to a Daisy, but
he simply uses the little flower, and not very successfully, as
a peg on which to hang the praises of his mistress. He uses
it more happily in describing the pleasures of a country life&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come live with me and thou shalt see<br /></span>

And again&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Young men and maids meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">To exercise their dancing feet,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>George Herbert had a deep love for flowers, and a still
deeper love for finding good Christian lessons in the commonest
things about him. He delights in being able to say&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yet can I mark how herbs below<br /></span>
<span class="i1i">Grow green and gay;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but I believe he never mentions the Daisy.</p>

<p>Of the poets of the seventeenth century I need only make
one short quotation from Dryden&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And then the band of flutes began to play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">To which a lady sang a tirelay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And still at every close she would repeat<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The burden of the song&mdash;'The Daisy is so sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The Daisy is so sweet'&mdash;when she began<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The troops of knights and dames continued on<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">The consort; and the voice so charmed my ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And soothed my soul that it was heaven to hear."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I need not dwell on the other poets of the seventeenth
century. In most of them a casual allusion to the Daisy
may be found, but little more. Nor need I dwell at all on
the poets of the eighteenth century. In the so-called
Augustan age of poetry, the Daisy could not hope to attract
any attention. It was the correct thing if they had to speak
of the country to speak of the "Daisied" or "Daisy-spangled"
meads, but they could not condescend to any
nearer approach to the little flower. If they had they would
have found that they had chosen their epithet very badly.
I never yet saw a "Daisy-spangled" meadow.<a name="FNanchor_370:1_232" id="FNanchor_370:1_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_370:1_232" class="fnanchor">[370:1]</a> The flowers
may be there, but the long Grasses effectually hide them.
And so I come <i>per saltum</i> to the end of the eighteenth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371"></a>[<a href="./images/371.png">371</a>]</span>century, and at once to Burns, who brought the Daisy again
into notice. He thus regrets the uprooting of the Daisy by
his plough&mdash;</p>

<p>With Burns we may well join Clare, another peasant poet
from Northamptonshire, whose poems are not so much
known as they deserve to be. His allusions to wild flowers
always mark his real observation of them, and his allusions
to the Daisy are frequent; thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Again, alluding to his own obscurity&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Green turfs allowed forgotten heap,<br /></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"></a>[<a href="./images/372.png">372</a>]</span>
Again, in his description of evening, he does not omit to
notice the closing of the Daisy at sunset&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now the blue fog creeps along,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>And so we come to Wordsworth, whose love of the Daisy
almost equalled Chaucer's. His allusions and addresses to
the Daisy are numerous, but I have only space for a small
selection. First, are two stanzas from a long poem specially
to the Daisy&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When soothed awhile by milder airs,<br /></span>

<p>The other poem from Wordsworth that I shall read to

<span class="i0i">That breath'st with me in sun and air;<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Do thou, as thou art wont, repair<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">My heart with gladness, and a share<br /></span>
<span class="i2i">Of thy meek nature."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With these beautiful lines I might well conclude my
notices of the poetical history of the Daisy, but, to bring
it down more closely to our own times, I will remind you
of a poem by Tennyson, entitled "The Daisy." It is a
pleasant description of a southern tour brought to his
memory by finding a dried Daisy in a book. He says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"We took our last adieu,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And up the snowy Splugen drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ere we reached the highest summit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I plucked a Daisy, I gave it you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It told of England then to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now it tells of Italy."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus I have picked several pretty flowers of poetry for
you from the time of Chaucer to our own. I could have
made the posy fifty-fold larger, but I could, probably, have
found no flowers for the posy more beautiful, or more
curious, than these few.</p>

<p>I now come to the botany of the Daisy. The Daisy
belongs to the immense family of the Composit&aelig;, a family
which contains one-tenth of the flowering plants of the
world, and of which nearly 10,000 species are recorded.
In England the order is very familiar, as it contains three
of our commonest kinds, the Daisy, the Dandelion, and the
Groundsel. It may give some idea of the large range of the
family when we find that there are some 600 recorded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374"></a>[<a href="./images/374.png">374</a>]</span>species of the Groundsel alone, of which eleven are in
England. I shall not weary you with a strictly scientific
description of the Daisy, but I will give you instead
Rousseau's well-known description. It is fairly accurate,
though not strictly scientific: "Take," he says, "one of
those little flowers, which cover all the pastures, and which
every one knows by the name of Daisy. Look at it well,
for I am sure you would never have guessed from its
appearance that this flower, which is so small and delicate,
is really composed of between two and three hundred other
flowers, all of them perfect, that is, each of them having its
corolla, stamens, pistil, and fruit; in a word, as perfect in
its species as a flower of the Hyacinth or Lily. Every one
of these leaves, which are white above and red underneath,
and form a kind of crown round the flower, appearing to
be nothing more than little petals, are in reality so many
true flowers; and every one of those tiny yellow things also
which you see in the centre, and which at first you have
perhaps taken for nothing but stamens, are real flowers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Pull
out one of the white leaves of the flower; you
will think at first that it is flat from one end to the other,
but look carefully at the end by which it was fastened to
the flower, and you will see that this end is not flat, but
round and hollow in the form of a tube, and that a little
thread ending in two horns issues from the tube. This
thread is the forked style of the flower, which, as you now
see, is flat only at top. Next look at the little yellow things
in the middle of the flower, and which, as I have told you,
are all so many flowers; if the flower is sufficiently advanced,
you will see some of them open in the middle and even cut
into several parts. These are the monopetalous corollas.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
This is enough to show you by the eye the
possibility that all these small affairs, both white and
yellow, may be so many distinct flowers, and this is a
constant fact" (Quoted in Lindley's "Ladies' Botany,"
vol. i.)<a name="FNanchor_374:1_234" id="FNanchor_374:1_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_374:1_234" class="fnanchor">[374:1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375"></a>[<a href="./images/375.png">375</a>]</span>
But Rousseau does not mention one feature which I wish
to describe to you, as I know few points in botany more
beautiful than the arrangement by which the Daisy is fertilized.
In the centre of each little flower is the style surrounded
closely by the anthers. The end of the style is
divided, but, as long as it remains below among the anthers,
the two lips are closed. The anthers are covered, more or
less, with pollen; the style has its outside surface bristling
with stiff hairs. In this condition it would be impossible
for the pollen to reach the interior (stigmatic) surfaces of
the divided style, but the style rises, and as it rises it brushes
off the pollen from the anthers around it. Its lips are closed
till it has risen well above the whole flower, and left the
anthers below; then it opens, showing its broad stigmatic
surface to receive pollen from other flowers, and distribute
the pollen it has brushed off, not to itself (which it could
not do), but to other flowers around it. By this provision
no flower fertilizes itself, and those of you who are acquainted
with Darwin's writings will know how necessary this provision
may be in perpetuating flowers. The Daisy not only produces
double flowers, but also the curious proliferous flower
called Hen and Chickens, or Childing Daisies, or Jackanapes
on Horseback. These are botanically very interesting
flowers, and though I, on another occasion, drew your
attention to the peculiarity, I cannot pass it over in a paper
specially devoted to the Daisy. The botanical interest is
this: It is a well-known fact in botany, that all the parts of
a plant&mdash;root, stem, flowers and their parts, thorns, fruits,
and even the seeds, are only different forms of leaves, and
are all interchangeable, and the Hen and Chickens Daisy is
a good proof of it. Underneath the flowerhead of the Daisy
is a green cushion, composed of bracts; in the Hen and
Chickens Daisy some of these bracts assume the form of
flowers, and are the chickens. If the plant is neglected, or
does not like its soil, the chickens again become bracts.</p>

<p>The only other point in the botany of the Daisy that
occurs to me is its geographical range. The old books are
not far wrong when they say "it groweth everywhere." It
does not, however, grow in the Tropics. In Europe it is
everywhere, from Iceland to the extreme south, though not
abundant in the south-easterly parts. It is found in North
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376"></a>[<a href="./images/376.png">376</a>]</span>America very sparingly, and not at all in the United States.
It is also by no means fastidious in its choice of position&mdash;by
the river-side or on the mountain-top it seems equally at
home, though it somewhat varies according to its situation,
but its most chosen habitat seems to be a well-kept lawn.
There it luxuriates, and defies the scythe and the mowing
machine. It has been asserted that it disappears when the
ground is fed by sheep, and again appears when the sheep
are removed, but this requires confirmation. Yet it does
not lend itself readily to gardening purposes. It is one of
those&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Flowers, worthy of Paradise, which not nice art<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">In beds and curious knots, but Nature's boon<br /></span>

<p class="authorpoem"><i>Paradise Lost</i>, iv, 240.</p>

<p>Under cultivation it becomes capricious; the sorts degenerate
and require much care to keep them true. As to its
time of flowering it is commonly considered a spring and
summer flower; but I think one of its chief charms is that
there is scarcely a day in the whole year in which you might
not find a Daisy in flower.</p>

<p>I have now gone through something of the history, poetry,
and botany of the Daisy, but there are still some few points
which I could not well range under either of these three
heads, yet which must not be passed over. In painting, the
Daisy was a favourite with the early Italian and Flemish
painters, its bright star coming in very effectively in their
foregrounds. Some of you will recollect that it is largely
used in the foreground of Van Eyck's grand picture of the
"Adoration of the Lamb," now at St. Bavon's, in Ghent. In
sculpture it was not so much used, its small size making it
unfit for that purpose. Yet you will sometimes see it, both
in the stone and wood carvings of our old churches. In
heraldry it is not unknown. When Philip the Bold, Duke
of Burgundy, was about to marry Margaret of Flanders, he
instituted an order of Daisies; and in Chifflet's Lilium
Francicum (1658) is a plate of his arms, France and
Flanders quarterly surrounded by a collar of Daisies. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a>[<a href="./images/377.png">377</a>]</span>family named Daisy bear three Daisies on their coat of
arms. In an old picture of Chaucer, a Daisy takes the
place in the corner usually allotted to the coat of arms in
medi&aelig;val paintings. It was assumed as an heraldic cognizance
by St. Louis of France in honour of his wife
Margaret; by the good Margaret of Valois, Queen of
Navarre; by Margaret of Anjou, the unfortunate wife of
our Henry VI.; while our Margaret, Countess of Richmond,
mother of our Henry VII., and dear to Oxford and
Cambridge as the foundress of the Margaret Professorships,
and of Christ College in Cambridge, bore three Daisies on
a green turf.</p>

<p>To entomologists the Daisy is interesting as an attractive
flower to insects; for "it is visited by nine hymenoptera,
thirteen diptera, three coleoptera, and two lepidoptera&mdash;namely,
the least meadow-brown and the common blue
butterflies."<a name="FNanchor_377:1_235" id="FNanchor_377:1_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_377:1_235" class="fnanchor">[377:1]</a></p>

<p>In medicine, I am afraid, the Daisy has so lost its virtues
that it has no place in the modern pharmacop&oelig;ia: but in
old days it was not so. Coghan says "of Deysies, they are
used to be given in potions in fractures of the head and
deep wounds of the breast. And this experience I have of
them, that the juyce of the leaves and rootes of Deysies
being put into the nosethrils purgeth the brain; they are
good to be used in pottage."<a name="FNanchor_377:2_236" id="FNanchor_377:2_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_377:2_236" class="fnanchor">[377:2]</a> Gerard says, "the Daisies do
mitigate all kinds of paines, especially in the joints, and
gout proceeding from a hot or dry humoure, if they be
stamped with new butter, unsalted, and applied upon the
pained place." Nor was this all. In those days, doctors
prescribed according to the so-called "doctrines of signatures,"
<i>i.e.</i>, it was supposed that Nature had shown, by
special marks, for what special disease each plant was useful;
and so in the humble growth of the little low-growing
Daisy the doctors read its uses, and here they are. "It is
said that the roots thereof being boyled in milk, and given
to little puppies, will not suffer them to grow great."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cole's</span>
<i>Adam in Eden</i>. One more virtue. Miss Pratt says that
"an author, writing in 1696, tells us that they who wish to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378"></a>[<a href="./images/378.png">378</a>]</span>have pleasant dreams of the loved and absent, should put
'Dazy roots under their pillow.'"</p>

<p>On the English language, the Daisy has had little influence,
though some have derived "lackadaisy" and "lackadaisical"
from the Daisy, but there is, certainly, no connection
between the words. Daisy, however, was (and, perhaps,
still is) a provincial adjective in the eastern counties. A
writer in "Notes and Queries" (2nd Series, ix. 261) says
that Samuel Parkis, in a letter to George Chalmers, dated
February 16, 1799, notices the following provincialisms:
"Daisy: remarkable, extraordinary excellent, as 'She's a
Daisy lass to work,' <i>i.e.</i>, 'She is a good working girl.' 'I'm a
Daisy body for pudding,' <i>i.e.</i>, 'I eat a great deal of pudding.'"</p>

<p>And I must not leave the Daisy without noticing one
special charm, that it is peculiarly the flower of childhood.
The Daisy is one of the few flowers of which the child may
pick any quantity without fear of scolding from the surliest
gardener. It is to the child the herald of spring, when it
can set its little foot on six at once, and it readily lends itself
to the delightful manufacture of Daisy chains.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In the spring and play-time of the year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the little ones, a sportive team,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Gather king-cups in the yellow mead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And prank their hair with Daisies."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cowper.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is then the special flower of childhood, but we cannot
entirely give it up to our children. And I have tried to
show you that the humble Daisy has been the delight of
many noble minds, and may be a fit subject of study even
for those children of a larger growth who form the "Bath
Field Club."</p>

<h2>THE SEASONS</h2>

<h2>OF SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS.</h2>

<p><span class="dropcapi"><span class="dropcap">I</span></span>N this paper I do not propose to
make any exhaustive inquiry into
the seasons of Shakespeare's plays,
but (at Mr. Furnivall's suggestion)
I have tried to find out whether in
any case the season that was in the
poet's mind can be discovered by
the flowers or fruits, or whether,
where the season is otherwise indicated,
the flowers and fruits are in
accordance. In other words, my inquiry is simply confined
to the argument, if any, that may be derived from the
flowers and fruits, leaving out of the question all other
indications of the seasons.</p>

<p><i>Two Noble Kinsmen.</i> Apricot, bulrush, cedar, plane,

<p>This I believe to be a complete list of the flowers of Shakespeare
arranged according to the plays, and they are mentioned
in one of three ways&mdash;first, adjectively, as "flaxen was
his pole," "hawthorn-brake," "barley-broth," "thou honeysuckle
villain," "onion-eyed," "cowslip-cheeks," but the
instances of this use by Shakespeare are not many; second,
proverbially or comparatively, as "tremble like aspen," "we
grew together like to a double cherry seeming parted," "the
stinking elder, grief," "thou art an elm, my husband, I a
vine," "not worth a gooseberry." There are numberless
instances of this use of the names of flowers, fruits, and
trees, but neither of these uses give any indication of the
seasons; and in one or other of these ways they are used
(and only in these ways) in the following plays:&mdash;<i>Tempest</i>,
<i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>, <i>Measure for Measure</i>, <i>Merchant
of Venice</i>, <i>As You Like It</i>, <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>, <i>Comedy of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385"></a>[<a href="./images/385.png">385</a>]</span>Errors</i>, <i>Macbeth</i>, <i>King John</i>, <i>1st Henry IV.</i>, <i>2nd Henry
VI.</i>, <i>3rd Henry VI.</i>, <i>Henry VIII.</i>, <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>,
<i>Coriolanus</i>, <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>, <i>Pericles</i>, <i>Othello</i>. These therefore
may be dismissed at once. There remain the following
plays in which indications of the seasons intended
either in the whole play or in the particular act may be
traced. In some cases the traces are exceedingly slight
(almost none at all); in others they are so strongly marked
that there is little doubt that Shakespeare used them of set
purpose and carefully:&mdash;<i>Merry Wives</i>, <i>Twelfth Night</i>,
<i>Much Ado</i>, <i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, <i>Love's Labour's Lost</i>,
<i>As You Like It</i>, <i>All's Well</i>, <i>Winter's Tale</i>, <i>Richard II.</i>,
<i>1st Henry IV.</i>, <i>Henry V.</i>, <i>2nd Henry VI.</i>, <i>Richard III.</i>,
<i>Timon of Athens</i>, <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, <i>Cymbeline</i>, <i>Titus
Andronicus</i>, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, <i>King Lear</i>, <i>Hamlet</i>, and
<i>Two Noble Kinsmen</i>.</p>

<p><i>Merry Wives.</i> Herne's oak gives the season intended&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8h">"Herne the hunter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doth <i>all the winter time</i> at still midnight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walk round about an oak with ragged horns."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If Shakespeare really meant to place the scene in mid-winter,
there may be a fitness in Mrs. Quickly's looking forward to
"a posset at night, at the latter end of a sea-coal fire," for it
was a "raw rheumatick day" (act iii, sc. 1), in Pistol's&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Take heed, ere summer comes, or cuckoo birds do sing,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>in Ford's "birding" and "hawking," and in the concluding
words&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i9">"Let us every one go home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire" (act v, sc. 5);<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but it is not in accordance with the literature of the day to
have fairies dancing at midnight in the depth of winter.</p>

<p><i>Twelfth Night.</i> We know that the whole of this play
occupies but a few days, and is chiefly "matter for a May
morning." This gives emphasis to Olivia's oath, "By the
roses of the Spring .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I love thee so" (act ii, sc. 4).</p>

<p><i>Much Ado.</i> The season must be summer. There is the
sitting out of doors in the "still evening, hushed on purpose
to grace harmony;" and it is the time of year for the full
leafage when Beatrice might</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386"></a>[<a href="./images/386.png">386</a>]</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"Steal into the pleached bower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forbid the sun to enter" (act iii, sc. 1).<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Midsummer Night's Dream.</i> The name marks the season,
and there is a profusion of flowers to mark it too. It may
seem strange to us to have "Apricocks" at the end of June,
but in speaking of the seasons of Shakespeare and others it
should be remembered that their days were twelve days later
than ours of the same names; and if to this is added the
variation of a fortnight or three weeks, which may occur in
any season in the ripening of a fruit, "apricocks" might
well be sometimes gathered on their Midsummer day. But
I do not think even this elasticity will allow for the ripening
of mulberries and purple grapes at that time, and scarcely
of figs. The scene, however, being laid in Athens and in
fairyland, must not be too minutely criticized in this respect.
But with the English plants the time is more accurately
observed. There is the "<i>green</i> corn;" the "dewberries,"
which in a forward season may be gathered early in July;
the "lush woodbine" in the fulness of its lushness at that
time; the pansies, or "love-in-idleness," which (says Gerard)
"flower not onely in the spring, but for the most part all
sommer thorowe, even untill autumne;" the "sweet musk-roses
and the eglantine," also in flower then, though the
musk-roses, being rather late bloomers, would show more of
the "musk-rose buds" in which Titania bid the elves "kill
cankers" than of the full-blown flower; while the thistle
would be exactly in the state for "Mounsieur Cobweb" to
"kill a good red-hipped humble bee on the top of it" to
"bring the honey-bag" to Bottom. Besides these there are
the flowers on the "bank where the wild thyme blows;
where oxlips and the nodding violet grows," and I think the
distinction worth noting between the "<i>blowing</i>" of the wild
thyme, which would then be at its fullest, and the "<i>growing</i>"
of the oxlips and the violet, which had passed their
time of blowing, but the living plants continued "growing."<a name="FNanchor_386:1_237" id="FNanchor_386:1_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_386:1_237" class="fnanchor">[386:1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387"></a>[<a href="./images/387.png">387</a>]</span>
<i>Love's Labour's Lost.</i> The general tone of the play points
to the full summer, the very time when we should expect to
find Boyet thinking "to close his eyes some half an hour
under the cool shade of a sycamore" (act v, sc. 2).</p>

<p><i>All's Well that Ends Well.</i> There is a pleasant note of
the season in&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The time will bring on summer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">When briars will have leaves as well as thorns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And be as sweet as sharp" (act iv, sc. 4);<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but probably that is only a proverbial expression of hopefulness,
and cannot be pushed further.</p>

<p><i>Winter's Tale.</i> There seems some little confusion in the
season of the fourth act&mdash;the feast for the sheep-shearing,
which is in the very beginning of summer&mdash;yet Perdita dates
the season as "the year growing ancient"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nor yet on summer's death, nor on the birth<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">Of trembling winter"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and gives Camillo the "flowers of middle summer." The
flowers named are all summer flowers; carnations or gilliflowers,
lavender, mints, savory, marjoram, and marigold.</p>

<p><i>Richard II.</i> There are several marked and well-known
dates in this play, but they are not much marked by the
flowers. The intended combat was on St. Lambert's day
(17th Sept.), but there is no allusion to autumn flowers. In
act iii, sc. 3, which we know must be placed in August,
there is, besides the mention of the summer dust, King
Richard's sad strain&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Our sighs, and they (tears) shall lodge the summer corn,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and in the same act we have the gardener's orders to trim
the rank summer growth of the "dangling apricocks," while
in the last act, which must be some months later, we have
the Duke of York speaking of "this new spring of time,"
and the Duchess asking&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8h">"Who are the violets now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That strew the green lap of the new-come spring?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and though in both cases the words may be used proverbially,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388"></a>[<a href="./images/388.png">388</a>]</span>yet it seems also probable that they may have been suggested
by the time of year.</p>

<p><i>2nd Henry IV.</i> There is one flower-note in act ii, sc. 4,
where the Hostess says to Falstaff, "Fare thee well! I have
known thee these twenty-five years come peascod time," of
which it can only be said that it must have been spoken at
some other time than the summer.</p>

<p><i>Henry V.</i> The exact season of act v, sc. 1, is fixed by
St. David's day (March 1) and the leek.</p>

<p><i>1st Henry VI.</i> The scene in the Temple gardens
(act ii, sc. 4), where all turned on the colour of the roses,
must have been at the season when the roses were in full
bloom, say June.</p>

<p><i>Richard III.</i> Here too the season of act ii, sc. 4, is fixed
by the ripe strawberries brought by the Bishop of Ely to
Richard. The exact date is known to be June 13, 1483.</p>

<p><i>Timon of Athens.</i> An approximate season for act iv,
sc. 3, might be guessed from the medlar offered by Apemantus
to Timon. Our medlars are ripe in November.</p>

<p><i>Antony and Cleopatra.</i> The figs and fig-leaves brought
to Cleopatra give a slight indication of the season of
act v.<a name="FNanchor_388:1_238" id="FNanchor_388:1_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_388:1_238" class="fnanchor">[388:1]</a></p>

<p><i>Cymbeline.</i> Here there is a more distinct plant-note of
the season of act i, sc. 3. The queen and her ladies,
"whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather flowers," which at
the end of the scene we are told are violets, cowslips, and
primroses, the flowers of the spring. In the fourth act
Lucius gives orders to "find out the prettiest daisied plot
we can," to make a grave for Cloten; but daisies are too
long in flower to let us attempt to fix a date by them.</p>

<p><i>Hamlet.</i> In this play the season intended is very distinctly
marked by the flowers. The first act must certainly
be some time in the winter, though it may be the end of
winter or early spring&mdash;"The air bites shrewdly, it is very
cold." Then comes an interval of two months or more,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389"></a>[<a href="./images/389.png">389</a>]</span>and Ophelia's madness must be placed in the early summer,
<i>i.e.</i>, in the end of May or the beginning of June; no other
time will all the flowers mentioned fit, but for that time they
are exact. The violets were "all withered;" but she could
pick fennel and columbines, daisies and pansies in abundance,
while the evergreen rosemary and rue ("which we
may call Herb of Grace on Sundays") would be always
ready. It was the time of year when trees were in their full
leafage, and so the "willow growing aslant the brook
would show its hoar leaves in the glassy stream," while its
"slivers," would help her in making "fantastic garlands"
"of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples," or
"dead men's fingers," all of which she would then be able
to pick in abundance in the meadows, but which in a few
weeks would be all gone. Perhaps the time of year may
have suggested to Laertes that pretty but sad address to his
sister,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"O Rose of May!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Titus Andronicus.</i> There is a plant-note in act ii,
sc. 2&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">O'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Romeo and Juliet.</i> A slight plant-note of the season
may be detected in the nightly singing of the nightingale in
the pomegranate tree in the third act.</p>

<p><i>King Lear.</i> The plants named point to one season only,
the spring. At no other time could the poor mad king
have gone singing aloud,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Crowned with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">With harlock, hemlocks, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0i">And darnel."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I think this would also be the time for gathering the fresh
shoots of the samphire; but I do not know this for certain.<a name="FNanchor_389:1_239" id="FNanchor_389:1_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_389:1_239" class="fnanchor">[389:1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390"></a>[<a href="./images/390.png">390</a>]</span>
<i>Two Noble Kinsmen.</i> Here the season is distinctly
stated for us by the poet. The scene is laid in May, and
the flowers named are all in accordance&mdash;daffodils, daisies,
marigolds, oxlips, primrose, roses, and thyme.</p>

<p>I cannot claim any great literary results from this inquiry
into the seasons of Shakespeare as indicated by the flowers
named; on the contrary, I must confess that the results are
exceedingly small&mdash;I might almost say, none at all&mdash;still I
do not regret the time and trouble that the inquiry has
demanded of me. In every literary inquiry the value of the
research is not to be measured by the visible results. It is
something even to find out that there are no results, and so
save trouble to future inquirers. But in this case the research
has not been altogether in vain. Every addition,
however small, to the critical study of our great Poet has its
value; and to myself, as a student of the Natural History
of Shakespeare, the inquiry has been a very pleasant one,
because it has confirmed my previous opinion, that even in
such common matters as the names of the most familiar
every-day plants he does not write in a careless hap-hazard
way, naming just the plant that comes uppermost in his
thoughts, but that they are all named in the most careful
and correct manner, exactly fitting into the scenes in which
they are placed, and so giving to each passage a brightness
and a reality which would be entirely wanting if the plants
were set down in the ignorance of guess-work. Shakespeare
knew the plants well; and though his knowledge is never
paraded, by its very thoroughness it cannot be hid.</p>

which it bears in "flowers of the field," "beasts of the field," the confusion
is avoided. The words would then refer to the wild overgrowth

<p><span class="dropcapf"><span class="dropcap">F</span></span>INDING that many are interested in
the old names of the plants named
by Shakespeare, I give in this appendix
the names of the plants,

writers in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. The list might have
been very largely increased, especially
by giving the forms used at
an earlier date, but my object is to show the forms of the
names in which they were (or might have been) familiar to
Shakespeare. The authors quoted are these:</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="book">ON THE ART OF GARDENING:</span> A Plea for
English Gardens of the Future, with Practical Hints for Planting
Them. By Mrs. <span class="smcap">J. Francis Foster</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Press Notices.</b></p>

<p>"In this pleasant and original little book the authoress not only enters a
vigorous protest against the bedding-out system and the so-called 'natural'
style of gardening, but gives very good practical advice for gardens of a
different sort."&mdash;<i>Gardener's Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>"This little book proceeds from a true lover of flowers and will be welcome
to all who take an interest in their care and culture."&mdash;<i>Civilian.</i></p>

<p>"A pleasant and unpretending little volume."&mdash;<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p>"The charm consists in its author's evident love of her subject. Like a
true lover she has gone far and wide in her search for old plants and old
plant lore. We agree with Mrs. Foster that the most perfect herbaceous
border is one that has an old wall behind it. Blue larkspurs and white
lilies, roses, phloxes, and evening primroses never look so well as when they
are seen against a background of wall, mellowed with age and clothed with
its beautiful garment of wall-growing seedlings.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mrs. Foster's book,
too, is most useful in its lists of flowers that bloomed in the days of Chaucer
and Shakespeare. She also devotes one chapter entirely to quotations from
old poets on gardens and all the delights that spring from them. If it helps
her readers to know for themselves those authors, who found among the
flowers of the garden apt similes of all that is truest in human nature, she
will have added a very substantial addition to the pleasure already enjoyed
by those who love gardens, but yet are unfamiliar with the pages of the
poets who knew well how to speak their praises."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>
